COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL & MIXED-OCCUPANCY (NON-RESIDENTIAL) COLLECTIONThe City of Albany finds the reduction of solid waste and the conservation of recyclables to be of great importance and the responsibility of public and private sectors alike. Therefore, the separation and collection of materials for recycling from all establishments within the City is mandated within City Code.All commercial, industrial, mixed-occupancy, multi-residential and institutional establishments within the City must arrange, maintain and contract for PRIVATE collection of their trash and recyclable items (paper, newspaper, cardboard, glass, cans and plastic containers). Commercial Recycling Quick ReferenceMULTI-RESIDENTIAL The owner, manager or superintendent of every multi-residential complex (more than (4) units) is responsible to provide, maintain and arrange for the PRIVATE collection of recyclable items (paper, newspaper, cardboard, glass, cans, and plastic containers) that are generated by residents of the complex. In cases where a condominium, cooperative, homeowner or similar association exists, the association shall be responsible for provision and maintenance of the recycling collection areas.IF recycling is NOT offered in your complex or mixed-use establishment, please contact DGS at (518) 434-2489 or email us here
