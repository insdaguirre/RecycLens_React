				Why is the fee being charged on only residential properties of less than four units?
			



The cost of trash collection is becoming more and more expensive, and room for waste is becoming limited in the City’s landfill. Therefore, for the past 4 years, the City imposed a waste collection fee on 2 to 4 unit properties (formerly $180, and now $90 per unit). This fee, coupled with other cost-saving measures by the City, offsets some of those costs.In 2018, the Albany Common Council decided to reduce this fee (to $90), but to extend it to all residential properties in the City, including single family residences.Properties with more than four units and commercial properties are already required to provide for their own trash pick-up, which is why they have been left out of the program.
Waste Collection Fee








				How will it be determined who will have to pay the fee?
			



The City uses information from its own property databases, tax records and New York State databases to generate a list of all residential properties in the City. We then eliminated everyone from that list who would be eligible for an exemption based on the information we had at hand.

				What if my residential unit will only be occupied for part of the year, may the fee be charged on a monthly basis? 
			



Unfortunately, the administrative costs providing and overseeing a per-month fee option were determined to be prohibitive and so the fee applies to all units occupied as residential units at any time in the year for which the fee applies.

				What documents are needed to prove I am entitled to an exemption?
			



If you believe that you are entitled to an exemption from the WCF in 2022, you must submit a completed Waste Collection Fee Exemption Application to the Treasurer’s office by December 31, 2021. The City, through New York State and/or the Department of Buildings and Regulatory Compliance, will work with you to help you prove your entitlement. The following is a list of documents which we suggest you submit along with your Waste Collection Fee Exemption Application.Private Hauling. If you are entitled to the private hauling exemption you should submit a copy of the contract covering the property to be exempted from the fee.The Unit is not Being Used as a Residence. If you are entitled to a non-residence use exemption because the unit is not required to have a Residential Occupancy Permit (ROP) according to Albany City Code § 231-130 the owner will have to submit the affirmation included on the back of the Waste Collection Fee Exemption Application form stating that the unit is not being used for residential purposes. *It should be noted that, a unit with an active ROP will be liable for the fee. An ROP may be surrendered by the owner and this, in addition to submission of an affirmation stating that the unit is not being used for residential purposes, will be needed to obtain an exemption.The Property is Vacant. If you are entitled to a non-residence use exemption because the property is vacant and fully compliant with the Vacant Building Registry Program as required by Albany City Code § 133-78, you should not receive a bill if your building is properly registered. If it is not registered, you will have to register the building as vacant on the vacant building registry or, if the building is vacant and not required to be on the vacant building registry, you will have to authorize the Department to verify this compliance. Specifically, a building which is vacant but is secured by normal means and in compliance with code for one year does not have to be registered on the vacant building registry. If the building is already registered, the Department and we will confirm.Age, Disability, Low Income. If you are entitled to a low income, aged or disability based property tax exemption, or the Enhanced Star exemption, then you should not receive a bill. However, errors are inevitable and if you do receive a bill for the fee, you should contact the Treasurer’s Office ASAP. They will confirm with the Assessor’s Office and/or NYS whether you in fact receive one of these credits. If you do not receive the credit, the Department cannot grant the exemption and you will have to apply to the proper tax authorities to obtain the exemption if you are entitled to it. Once that exemption has been granted, the waste collection fee exemption will be granted.
