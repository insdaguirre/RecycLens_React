Yardwaste Collection




The City of Albany, Department of General Services would like you to know that residents are NOT permitted to rake or place their yard waste loosely into the city streets for collection. 


Yard waste is collected curbside from April 15th through December 1st (or the first snowfall, whichever occurs first).





According to the Codes for the City of Albany, Section 313-4B(2), "Grass, leaves and other yard waste debris shall be placed in biodegradable paper bags approved for such use and/or made available by the City of Albany and placed at curbside for collection." Violators of this code may be subject to a fine and a bill equal to cost of clean up. ​


Raking leaves into the streets creates an unnecessary burden on the street sweepers and results in the leaf loads consuming valuable landfill space when they should be organically recycled.


  Please put your yard waste in biodegradeable bags and place the bags curbside on your designated collection day*. This way, the yard waste will NOT go to the landfill. Instead, it WILL be transformed into highly desireable compost, which is free to residents and perfect for your home garden.
