Recycling for Residents
ALL NYC residents and businesses are required to recycle. We provide free curbside recycling collection for NYC residents and schools.
Businesses must arrange to have their recycling collected by a licensed private carter
What to Recycle

Metal, glass, plastic, and cartons
Mixed paper and cardboard

How to Recycle
Set out recycling at the curb in a labeled bin (55 gallons or less) with a secure lid after 6:00 PM, or in a clear plastic bag after 8:00 PM.
Use your own bin or purchase an Official NYC Bin for recycling. Plastic bags used for recycling should be CLEAR.
Cardboard can be bundled (flattened and tied with twine) and set out next to bins or bags. DO NOT use cardboard boxes as bins.

Download and print a Metal, Glass, Plastic, and Cartons Recycling decal.
Download and print a Mixed Paper and Cardboard Recycling decal.

To ensure collection, all recycling must be set out by midnight.
Waste Bin Disposal
Waste bins that are mostly plastic or metal are recyclable.
Set out unwanted trash, recycling, and compost bins with your recycling. Turn them upside down and include a note to indicate that they should be collected with recycling.
Set out all other non-recyclable waste bins (cans, pails, containers) with trash.
Buildings with 4+ Residential Units
Building owners/managers with four or more residential units MUST designate at least one area for recycling storage.
The storage area MUST:

Be reasonably accessible to residents;
Provide enough bins for proper separation and the prevention of material overflow;
Display signage about recycling requirements and have bins clearly labeled.

Failure to do so may result in fines that increase with each new offense.
