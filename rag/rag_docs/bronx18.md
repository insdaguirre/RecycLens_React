Mercury and Mercury-Containing Devices
It is ILLEGAL to discard liquid mercury and devices containing mercury into the trash or recycling. Do not discard liquid mercury down the drain or toilet.
New thermometers and household medical equipment sold in NY State do not contain mercury.
A mercury thermometer can be easily identified by the presence of a silver bulb. (One exception to this is the new fever thermometers containing gallium, indium and tin that also contain a silver bulb but are clearly marked "mercury-free.") If the bulb is red, blue, purple, green or any other color, it is not a mercury thermometer.
Older devices that may contain mercury include:

Thermostats
Fever and basal thermometers
Oven, candy and meat thermometers
Indoor/outdoor thermometers
Laboratory thermometers
Temperature measuring devices in industrial applications
Blood pressure cuffs

Residential Mercury Disposal
It is ILLEGAL to discard liquid mercury and devices containing mercury into the trash or recycling. Do not discard liquid mercury down the drain or toilet.
Bring to a SAFE Disposal Event or contact an appropriate private hazardous/chemical waste company.
Business Mercury Disposal
New York State law requires wholesalers of thermostats to serve as collection sites for mercury thermostats. Thermostat retailers and HVAC contractors may choose to serve as collection sites.
Wholesalers, retailers, and HVAC contractors in NYS are all eligible to receive a free collection container from the Thermostat Recycling Corporation, which operates a program to collect and properly dispose of mercury thermostats.
When removing mercury thermostats, HVAC contractors should handle the thermostats separately from other items and place them in the collection container. Contractors who don't have their own collection bin can use a Thermostat Recycling Corporation drop-off location.
