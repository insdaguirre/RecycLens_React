Collection Laws for Residents
Residential property owners are responsible for making sure all waste for their building – including trash, recycling, and composting (food scraps and yard waste) – is set out correctly for collection.
Fines may be issued for each violation, and the amount may increase with each additional violation issued within a 12-month period.
Setout
As of November 12, 2024, single- and two-family homes, and properties with up to 9 residential units must use bins with secure lids for trash set out.
Residential Buildings with 1-9 Units

Set out trash after 6:00 PM in bins, 55 gallons or less, with secure lids

Residential Buildings with 10+ Units

Set out waste after 6:00 PM in bins, 55 gallons or less, with a secure lid, or
Set out waste after 8:00 PM, if putting bags directly on the curb

All waste should be set out by midnight, unless specified otherwise.
If you set your waste out incorrectly, at the wrong time, or on the wrong day, you may be fined.

Enforcement

$50 for the first offense
$100 for the second offense
$200 for the third and subsequent offenses


Bins
As of November 12, 2024, single- and two-family homes and buildings with up to 9 apartments must use bins with secure lids for trash setout.
Bins must must be 55 gallons or less, with secure lids, and they must be in relatively good condition.
Do not overload bins – you must be able to securely close lids to contain waste and keep pest out. You should have enough bins to contain all your trash and composting material.
If you own a single-family home, duplex, or property with up to 9 residential units, and your trash or compost is not fully contained within bins, you may be fined.
If your bins are broken, are not covered by secured lids, or if waste spills out from them, you may be fined.
Recycling bins must be clearly labeled. If your recycling is inside bags, the bags must be CLEAR plastic. DO NOT use cardboard boxes as bins.
If you do not set out your recycling correctly, you may be fined.

Enforcement

$50 for the first offense
$100 for the second offense
$200 for the third and subsequent offenses


Separation
ALL NYC residents and businesses are required to recycle.
If you do not separate your recyclables and composting from trash, or if you do not properly separate and set out recyclables correctly, you may be fined.
Metal, Glass, Plastic, and Cartons
Metal, glass jars and bottles, rigid plastics, and cartons must be separated from household trash and set out together in labeled bins with secure lids or in CLEAR plastic bags.
Mixed Paper and Cardboard
Mixed paper and cardboard must be separated from household trash and set out together in labeled bins with secure lids or in CLEAR plastic bags. Cardboard can also be bundled (flattened and tied with twine) and set out next to bins or bags. DO NOT use cardboard boxes as bins
Leaf and Yard Waste and Food Scraps
Leaf and yard waste, food scraps, and food-soiled paper should be set out inside labeled bins (55 gallons or less) with secure lids or in your DSNY brown compost bins. You can line your bins with CLEAR plastic, paper, or compostable bags to help keep them clean.
