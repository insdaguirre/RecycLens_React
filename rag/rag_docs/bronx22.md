Plant, Leaf, and Yard Waste
Most plant material — including flowers, house plants, leaves, twigs, branches, and grass clippings — can be turned into compost or used to create renewable energy.
Curbside Composting
All NYC residents can now set out plant, leaf, and yard waste for Curbside Composting collection.
