Appliances
Many household appliances are too large to fit in a bin or bag, and some require special handling before they can be collected.
Large Appliances
For large items – like dishwashers, microwaves, ovens and ranges, washers and dryers, and water heaters – that are too large to fit in a bin or bag, follow the rules for large (bulk) items:
Set out:

Items that are mostly metal or plastic with recycling
All other non-recyclable items with trash

Large items that aren't recyclable should be set out on your trash-only day, NOT your recycling day. You can set out up to 6 large items at the curb per collection day.
Appliances with CFC
Appliances that cool or chill – like air conditioners, dehumidifiers, refrigerators and freezers, and water and wine coolers – contain Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) Gas, also called Freon. Before these appliances can be collected and safely recycled, the CFC/Freon must be removed by trained DSNY personnel.
We provide free curbside removal of CFC/Freon (except R600a or R32 refrigerant).
Learn more about making an appointment for CFC removal.
Once DSNY personnel remove the CFC/Freon, a sticker will be placed on the appliance. Please leave the appliance at the curb and it will be collected with your recycling.
Appliances with Flammable Refrigerant R600a/R32
Some newer appliances contain R600a or R32 refrigerant, which we CANNOT collect. Look for the warning sticker (yellow triangle with black flames). Contact the appliance's manufacturer or a private carter for safe disposal options.
Small Appliances
For smaller appliances – like blenders, coffee makers, desk fans, humidifiers, paper shredders, toaster ovens, and vacuum cleaners (with cords) – that are mostly metal or plastic, set out with your recycling.
NOTE: For appliances with rechargeable batteries – like handheld vacuums, lawn mowers and trimmers, and power tools – batteries must be removed and disposed of properly before being setting out.
Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detectors
Dispose of smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and detectors with your trash (batteries removed).
Some smoke and carbon monoxide detectors contain small amounts of radioactive material. Check the label or look for manufacturer's instructions. While you can put these ionization detectors in the trash, many manufacturers offer take back programs. You can also bring them to a DSNY SAFE Disposal Event.
NOTE: Learn more about disposing of fire extinguisher and other gas cylinders.
