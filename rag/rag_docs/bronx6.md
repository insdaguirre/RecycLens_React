Batteries
While you can put "household" alkaline batteries in the trash, it is DANGEROUS and ILLEGAL to dispose of all rechargeable and most single-use batteries with trash or recycling.
Batteries can catch fire and even explode. Improper disposal can lead to serious property damage, injury, and even death. Keep yourself and others safe by following battery disposal guidelines.
Disposal
To get rid of non-alkaline batteries, you can:

Find a drop-off location at a store near you
Visit a Special Waste Drop-off site
Bring them to a SAFE Disposal event

NOTE: Batteries should be individually bagged or have ends/terminals taped before disposal.
In-Store Drop-Off
All stores in New York State that sell rechargeable batteries or products containing them MUST accept rechargeable batteries for recycling. These include hardware stores, office supply stores, drugstores, and electronics stores.
If a store that sells rechargeable batteries refuses to accept your batteries, contact the NY State Department of Environmental Conservation online or call 1-800-TIPP DEC (1-800-847-7332).
Battery Types
Rechargeable and Lithium-Ion
DO NOT put rechargeable or lithium-ion batteries in the trash or recycling.
These batteries are commonly used in cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, rechargeable household appliances and power tools, and electric bikes and scooters. These batteries can store a large amount of energy and can pose a threat if not stored and disposed of properly.
Button Cell and Coin
DO NOT put button-cell or coin batteries in the trash or recycling.
These batteries are commonly used in watches, hearing aids, car keyless entry remotes, toys, calculators, and musical greeting cards. They contain silver and mercury and pose a swallowing risk for children.
Automotive and Car
DO NOT put automotive or car batteries in the trash or recycling.
These batteries are commonly used in cars, trucks, recreational vehicles, and boats. These batteries contain lead and acid. They can be returned to any service station or auto supply store that sells them. Learn more about disposing of vehicle batteries and other automotive waste. 
Single-use Alkaline
Non-rechargable alkaline batteries can be discarded with regular trash.
These common, everyday batteries (AA, AAA, C, D, and 9-Volt) are found in many household items. They no longer contain mercury or other harmful heavy metals, so are not considered hazardous. Tape the ends/terminals of D and 9V batteries to prevent the risk of sparks and fires.
Businesses
