Clothing, Household Fabrics, and Accessories
While you can put clothing, shoes, linens, and other household fabrics in the trash, you can also bring them to thrift stores, retail take-back programs, textile recyclers, and drop-off bins.
Recycled items are diverted away from landfill and can be resold, donated, or reprocessed for industrial use as cleaning rags, stuffing, and insulation.
Textile Recycling
Most clothing and textile recycling sites accept:

Clean clothing and coats (new, gently-used, or damaged)
Accessories (shoes, hats, bags, gloves)
Household fabrics (towels, curtains, bedding)

Some also accept other fabric-based items, such as:

Backpacks and luggage
Blankets and comforters
Fabric and clean rags
Rugs
Stuffed animals

Contact locations for more information about what items they accept.
Textile Recycling Drop-Off
Drop-off location hours may vary. Farmers' markets are seasonal and may be closed when the weather is bad.

DSNY-Hosted Textile Drop-Off Sites
DSNY hosts textile bins for NYC residents to recycle clothing, shoes, accessories, linens, and fabric of all kinds. All items should be clean, dry, odorless, and in bags.
Sites are open every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM (closed legal holidays and during severe weather).
NOTE: Items donated at these sites are not tax deductible.
