Dead Animals
On Public Property
You can report a dead animal for removal from public areas, such as:

Sidewalk
Streets
Highways
Parks
Beaches
Bodies of water

Report a dead animal on public property.
On Private Property
Property owners are responsible for disposing of dead animals on their property.
You can dispose of a dead animal by placing it in a sealed heavy-duty black plastic bag and/or double plastic bag and setting it out for collection with your household trash. You must tape a note to the bag stating its contents ("dead dog" or "dead cat").
Exceptions
Rabies
If the animal showed signs of rabies, call 911. If an animal may have been rabid, DO NOT put in out with your garbage.
Animal bites
If the animal bit a person before it died, call 311 or report it online.
Animal clusters
If you are seeing clusters of dead birds, fish, or other wildlife, call 311.
Deer
If the dead animal is a deer, submit a request to have the deer removed from your property.
