Recycling


 









 
Covered Load Guidelines:
One of the primary challenges of our recycling program is contamination, which is non-recyclable materials that are put into recycling bins and ultimately disposes of. It is increasingly important to reduce the amount of contaminants in recycling streams to maintain a sustainable recycling system. The below Recycling Quick Guide shows some of the most basic and common materials we do accept and a few of the contaminates many mistakenly place in their recycling bin. Recycling Quick Guide 2019
