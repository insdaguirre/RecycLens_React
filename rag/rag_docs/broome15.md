What is Household Hazardous Waste? 
Household hazardous waste is unusable home and garden products, which contain hazardous chemicals. Examples include pesticides, fertilizers, oil-based paints and thinners, cleaners, pool and hobby chemicals. 
Improper disposal of household hazardous waste can pollute water resources, increase risks to human health safety and adversely affect sewage treatment.
