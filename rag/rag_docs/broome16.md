Ignitability (such as paints, solvents, and degreasers)
Corrosivity (such as acids and heavy-duty cleaners)
Reactivity (such as bleaches and oxidizing agents)
Toxicity (such as pesticides and herbicides)
Electronics are also accepted under the Commercial Hazardous Waste Program for those that qualify.
