Paint Recycling


 









New York State has implemented a Paint Stewardship Program which will simplify the process of recycling latex and oil-based paints. The New York Paint Stewardship Program is run by the organization Paint Care. 
You can learn more about accepted paint products and drop off locations on the Paint Care website. We have also listed locations within Broome County below. 
Latex and oil-based paint is accepted at the Broome County Landfill during normal business hours Mon-Fri 7am-2:45pm and Sat 7am-11:45am at no cost for our residents.
When bringing paint to the Broome County Landfill there is no need to dry it out first. Empty dry latex paint cans can go in your normal garbage. 
Alternative Drop Off Locations: Sherwin Williams & Greenes Ace Home Center
These locations accept up to 5 gallons of paint per visit (Greenes Ace accepts up to 10 gallons) from homes and businesses during their normal business hours. These locations accept both latex and oil-based paint but do not accept aerosols (spray paint) or containers without labels or containers that are leaking or empty.
