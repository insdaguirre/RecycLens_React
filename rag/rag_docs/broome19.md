Electronics Recycling


 









The New York State Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act requires manufacturers to provide free and convenient recycling of electronic waste to most consumers in the state.
On January 1, 2015, covered electronic equipment may no longer be accepted for disposal at a solid waste management facility from any person as garbage. Residents are required to properly recycle electronics covered by the Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act. Electronics are still accepted as part of the County hazardous waste & electronics recycling program at the landfill.
For more information and text of the Act visit NYS Department of Environmental Conservation.
You can also find a full list of Covered Electronic Equipment Manufacturers and their Acceptance Programs HERE.

The Broome County Landfill offers free drop-off for electronics during normal business hours for Broome County residents ONLY. Tioga County residents can only participate in electronics disposal at the Broome County Landfill on the free Household Hazardous Waste drop-off days from April through November. Tioga County residents may also use an alternative outlet, if applicable. Please be prepared to show proof of residency.
Household Hazardous Waste Free Drop-Off Days hours are always: 7:30am to 11:30am.
