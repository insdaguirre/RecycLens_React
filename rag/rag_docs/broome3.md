Apartment Bins
Apartments bins are designed to be smaller for an easier way to store recycling in an apartment before transferring the material to a larger curbside bin within the complex. They are not intended for outdoor use. These bins can be requested in bulk by landlords, or individually by tenants. One free 6-gallon bin per unit within Broome County. Demographic information will be requested before pickup.
