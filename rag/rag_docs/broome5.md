Business Recycling


 










Broome County's Mandatory Source Separation Law requires all businesses and individuals to separate their recyclables for collection.
Under Broome County Law, your garbage hauler is prohibited from dumping designated recyclables in the Broome County Landfill.
Implementing a Recycling Program
Reduce Your Waste
Recycling isn't the only way to reduce waste.  Look for ways to reduce the amount of waste you create by purchasing durable or reusable materials.  Employees can provide other cost saving suggestions to help your business conserve resources.
Buy Recycled
Purchase products made from or packaged in recycled materials. Consider using recycled materials in manufacturing and have your company's letterhead and brochures printed on recycled paper.
Your commitment to buying recycled products helps foster the development of the recycling industry and lets your customers know you care about the environment. Although some recycled products may cost a little more than non-recycled equivalents, as the recycled market grows, prices will fall. The more businesses buy recycled products, the faster those prices will fall.
Need Assistance?
The Division of Solid Waste can provide free assistance to your business to improve or implement a recycling program or to provide waste reduction tips. Call 607.778.2250 or email Debra.Smith@broomecountyny.gov for more information.
