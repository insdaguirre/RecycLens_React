Composting


 









Backyard composting is an effective way of recycling organic wastes such as leaves, grass and food scraps that are generated at home. Composting at home is easy and helps to keep waste out of our landfills.

Learn more about composting from videos on the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Broome County Youtube Page

4 Main Composting Ingredients
Nitrogen: Green materials such as yard waste, grass clippings, vegetable and fruit scraps (be sure to bury these deep in the pile)
Carbon: Brown, dry materials such as dry leaves, twigs, or straw should make up most of your compost. Be sure to chip any large/thick woody branches prior to composting. The Browns to Greens Ratio should be 3:1 by volume. 
Water: Your compost pile should be moist similar to a wrung-out sponge. The moisture content to be about 40 to 60 percent. To test for moisture, grab a handful of compost and squeeze it, if only a few drops of water come out your moisture content is optimal. You can add water when turning a pile during dry weather if needed. If your pile is too moist make sure it is draining properly and place a cover on it to prevent rain/snow from adding any more to the pile. 
Air: You want your pile to be well aerated to allow the beneficial microorganisms to break down the organic matter. A poorly aerated pile will have slow decomposition and a rotten odor. You want to turn or fluff your pile with a pitchfork or turning tool about once a week. Your well aerated pile should smell like earth and will be warm in the center.
