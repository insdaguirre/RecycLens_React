Holiday Recycling Facts
From Thanksgiving to New Years Day, household waste increases by more than 25%. Added food waste, shopping bags, packaging, wrapping paper, bows and ribbons - it all adds up to an additional 1 million tons a week to our landfills. 
2.1 billion Christmas cards are sent to friends and loved ones every year, making Christmas the largest card-sending occasion in the United States.
The amount of cards sold during the holiday season would fill a football field 10 stories high, and requires the harvesting of nearly 300,000 trees.
