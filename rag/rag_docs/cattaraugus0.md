Refuse Division Public Education - Glass




Apr. 18, 2025


 
 
CATTARAUGUS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS PRESENTS
Glass Recycling
April 2025 Edition | Refuse Division Fun Facts
 
DID YOU KNOW? 
There are many different types of glass, and not all types are able to be successfully recycled. As of April 2025, Cattaraugus County can take CLEAR CONTAINER GLASS as a recyclable. 
Other types of glass should be disposed of with regular garbage (AKA Municipal Solid Waste, or MSW). 
 
WHAT KIND OF GLASS IS IT?
"So, how do I know whether my glass is recyclable?" Time to find out! First, determine the category:


MAJOR GLASS CATEGORIES


Clear


Color

Crystal



 
Then, determine the type:


COMMON GLASS TYPES

Container
Pyrex
Table/cookware
Decorative
Window



 
LET'S TRY IT
Our example is an empty, clean GREEN bottle, which could have held wine or similar. 
Category: COLORED GLASS (it's a green bottle)
VERDICT: REGULAR GARBAGE
Why? Only CLEAR CONTAINER glass is accepted as a recyclable at Cattaraugus County Transfer Stations, so this bottle will need to be placed with MSW (regular garbage). 
 
SAFETY TIP
How to dispose of glass in your regular garbage: 

Try not to break it!
If already broken, put it in a cardboard box or other container (old grocery bag, oatmeal container, plastic coffee container - etc.!) or double bag your MSW to prevent your bag tearing. 

 
RECYCLING EXAMPLE
Our example this time is an empty, clean CLEAR bottle, which could have held wine or sparkling water, etc. The category is "clear" and the type is "container." VERDICT: RECYCLING!

This clear bottle is considered "container glass" and can be recycled at no cost at any Cattaraugus County Transfer Station. 
Other examples of clear container glass include: mason jars, milk bottles (from the old days!), pickle or jelly jars, clear bottles like the one in the example

 
ALTERNATIVES
Another example might be a set of pink crystal glassware for dining. This would be categorized as "crystal" and technically would be included with regular garbage. 
HOWEVER... 

There are other sustainable alternatives you might consider when preparing to dispose of certain glass products!
Gently used Pyrex, tableware and/or cookware, and decorative glass items can often be regifted, donated, or (item dependent) resold!

 
CATTARAUGUS COUNTY FEES
All transfer stations have a glass bin for CLEAR GLASS CONTAINERS. These items are accepted at no charge. 
Any glass disposed of with regular garbage (MSW) will be included as part of the bag waste fee. 
MSW/BAG WASTE FEES

Garbage bag up to 16 gallon, or equivalent $1.50
Garbage bag 17–35 gallon, or equivalent $3.00
Garbage bag 36–48 gallon, or equivalent $4.50
Garbage bag 49–64 gallon, or equivalent $6.00
Scaled per ton of solid waste (Salamanca only) $75.00 ($70.00 for permitted waste haulers)

 
AVOID "WISH-CYCLING"
By throwing non-accepted items into the glass recycling, the recycling load becomes contaminated and can be rejected by the processor. When a load is rejected, the County incurs additional costs for disposal and hauling.
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS... Speak with a transfer station operator! They are friendly, knowledgeable, and can help determine where items should be placed!
