Refuse Division Public Education - Cardboard




Mar. 24, 2025


 
 
CATTARAUGUS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS PRESENTS
Cardboard Recycling
March 2025 Edition | Refuse Division Fun Facts
 
DID YOU KNOW? 
Clean, baled, corrugated cardboard has end-market value - this means it can be sold to mills for recycling!
Unfortunately, “contaminated” cardboard cannot be sold, and its disposal costs money. At Cattaraugus County Transfer Stations, you may be asked to remove any contaminated cardboard from your recycling. It will then be charged the same disposal fee as regular municipal solid waste.
WHAT IS CONTAMINATION?

Liquids (wet cardboard)
Food grease
Glue or paper mache-type additives

 
TYPES OF "CARDBOARD"
DID YOU KNOW that some items that look like cardboard are actually regular waste or paper?


WAX BOARD: place with regular garbage

Waxy finish, usually refrigerated items
		
Example: MILK CARTONS





BOXBOARD/PAPERBOARD: recyclable with paper products

Thicker than regular paper
Usually with logo or art printed on it
		
Examples: SIX PACK CARRIERS; CEREAL BOXES





 
CATTARAUGUS COUNTY FEES
RECYCLYING CLEAN, DRY, CORRUGATED CARDBOARD AT ANY CATTARAUGUS COUNTY TRANSFER STATION IS FREE OF CHARGE
 
SAVING BY THE BALE
CATTARAUGUS COUNTY IS PRODUCING BALED CARDBOARD!
In the summer of 2024, a baler was purchased and installed at the Salamanca Transfer Station. This equipment is used to compact recyclable materials together so that they can be easily transported (a lot like hay bales!). 
Local paper mills will collect (and pay for) bales of corrugated cardboard - saving the County taxpayer hauling expenses!
AS OF MARCH 2025

Unbaled cardboard is worth ~$5/ton
Baled cardboard is valued at ~$95/ton!

 
FUN FACTS


Over 90% of products in the United States are shipped in corrugated cardboard boxes.


The average American will use approximately seven (7) trees each year in paper & cardboard products!


Recycling one (1) ton of cardboard saves over NINE (9) cubic yards of landfill space - as well as 700 gallons of water, and 46 gallons of oil.
