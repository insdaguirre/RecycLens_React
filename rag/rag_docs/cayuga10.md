Yard Waste		






Yard waste includes brush, small twigs, branches, limbs, and leaves typically gathered after completing some form of yard work. This kind of material can be used for many purposes including as a component of at-home composting. But often times Towns, Villages, or Cities will collect yard waste either through curbside collection or drop-off locations. Contact your local municipality or waste collection provider to see if/how they collect yard wastes in your community!
