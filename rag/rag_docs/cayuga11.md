OverviewNew York State has partnered with PaintCare, a nonprofit organization dedicated to paint recycling, to implement the State's Paint Stewardship Program. This initiative provides residents, businesses, and institutions with convenient, environmentally responsible options for disposing of leftover paint products.Those interested in disposing of their used and/or old paint products can do so at one of the many locations throughout the State (see below) for FREE. Residents can bring up to 5 gallons of paint products to dispose of at each location. It is recommended to call the location ahead of your visit to confirm business hours and that they can accept your paint products. How the Program WorksThe State's Paint Stewardship Program was established in 2022 and is funded through a small fee included in the price of new paint purchases. These funds support the collection, transportation, recycling, and proper disposal of unused paint across the state.Accepted Paint ProductsThe program accepts most types of paint products, including:Interior and Exterior Architectural Paints: latex, acrylic, water-based, alkyd, oil-based, enamelDeck Coatings and Floor PaintsPrimers, Sealers, and UndercoatersStainsShellacs, Lacquers, Varnishes, and UrethanesWaterproofing Concrete/Masonry/Wood Sealers and Repellents Metal Coatings and Rust PreventativesField and Lawn PaintsAny leaking, unlabeled, and empty containers are not accepted through the program. Additionally, any paint products not listed above are not accepted. Drop-Off LocationsPaintCare has established a network of drop-off sites throughout New York, including:Paint and hardware storesRecycling centersOther participating retail locationsTo find a drop-off site near you, visit PaintCare's New York Program webpage. For businesses or organizations with large quantities of leftover paint, PaintCare offers a free pickup service.
