Paper and Cardboard		






Overview Most paper and cardboard products are easily recycled and should always be separated from household trash. However, there are certain scenarios in which deciding whether to put a paper product in the trash or recycling bin can get tricky. Generally, as long as it is not lined with a plastic film, coated with wax, or covered In embellishments such as glitter, velvet, or foil, it can be recycled. Labels, plastic windows, staples, and a little tape can be okay to include as well. SOMETHING TO REMEMBER: Recycling practices vary depending on where you are located in the County and if you are unsure what to do with a certain paper product, you should reach out to your recycling provider.

 Confidential Documents





Confidential documents can include: medical documents, bank information, credit card statements, tax forms, or any other records containing account numbers. To help safeguard your confidential information, we recommend shredding these types of documents prior to recycling them. See below for some local resources for confidential document shredding services:UPS Store (Auburn)Pro Shred SecurityTompkins Community Bank Shred Days





 Office Paper





Both high-grade (printing paper) and low-grade (colored paper, stock paper, and ground wood paper) papers are recyclable. High-grade papers are typically recycled into more office paper but can also be recycled into tissue paper, paperboard, stationery, magazines, and other paper products. Low-grade papers can be recycled into cardboard, tissues, newspaper, and toilet paper.





 Corrugated Cardboard





Corrugated cardboard consists of 3 layers of brown kraft paper combined to make a strong and stiff material. Corrugated cardboard should almost always be separated from household trash and recycled. When recycled, cardboard can be used to make products like cereal boxes, paperboard, paper towels, tissues and printing or writing paper, or more cardboard. 





 Books





First and foremost, books should be reused or donated before considering disposal or recycling. If you must dispose of a book, you must first separate the pages from the bindings as they cannot be recycled due to the presence of glue. You can trash the bindings and place the paper pages in the recycling bin. 





 Magazines





Magazines, due to their glossy texture, are generally thought to not be recyclable. However, depending on your recycling provider, magazines can and should be recycled. They can be recycled into newspaper, tissues, writing paper and paperboard.





 Newspapers





Newspapers, though they are made up of a large amount of recycled fiber, can be further recycled to create cereal boxes, egg cartons, pencil barrels, grocery bags, tissue paper, new newspapers and other products including cellulose insulation.





 Junk Mail





Junk mail should be separated from other household trash and recycled, even if the envelope contains a bit of plastic. 





 Paperboard (cereal boxes, juice cartons, etc.)





Paperboard may be coated with wax or plastic to prevent leaks, which causes confusion for many as to whether it is recyclable or not. Generally speaking, paperboard can and should be separated from household trash and recycled, but it depends on your communities recycling program. 





 Paper Towels





For various reasons, including their make up of extremely low quality paper fibers and the typical presence of residue, paper towels should not be recycled but rather placed with the household trash. The same goes for napkins, and tissues.
