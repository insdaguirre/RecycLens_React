OverviewPlastic generation is a global problem. Across the world, and here in Cayuga County, plastics are being produced at very high rates but being recycled at very low rates. As a result, large quantities of plastic materials are being dumped into landfills. However, our communities can help change that one step at a time. The first, and often regarded as the most important, step is understanding plastics - what they are and how to best dispose of them!The Types of Plastics and What to Do With ThemThere are 7 different categories of plastic, all with different chemical compositions and values. Each type of plastic should be regarded individually, as not all plastics are recyclable. #1 and #2 plastics are very easily recycled and should always be separated from other household garbage. All other plastics are harder to recycle and should be handled on a case by case basis with direction from your recycling provider. See below for a breakdown of the types of plastics, and remember that recycling programs vary depending on where you are in the County and you should always double check with your recycling provider to learn how to recycle right!
