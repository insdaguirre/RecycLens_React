DeconstructionWhen buildings and structures are demolished, materials are often sent to the landfill due to being damaged or forgotten about. Deconstruction offers an opportunity to salvage architecturally significant and potentially reusable building materials (or items found within the building) prior to being demolished and landfilled. Deconstruction prevents materials from being landfilled and makes used materials available for the local community (often at low costs).
