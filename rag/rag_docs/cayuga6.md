Furniture and Large Appliances		






OverviewFurniture and large household appliances are typically not collected in residential curbside disposal and recycling programs. They disrupt the collection process due to their size and material make up. Many household appliances, including refrigerators and air conditioners, contain Freon which must be carefully removed before recycling. How To Get Rid of Furniture and Large Appliances

 Reuse





If the item is still in working condition, it does not need to be thrown away - it can be reused or donated! You can donate it to one of the many reuse/thrift stores in the area (see below). Always call ahead before dropping the item off to make sure they will accept it!Salvation ArmyThrifty ShopperFinger Lakes ReUseCortland ReUse





 Disposal





If the item is broken or is otherwise unusable, it should be thrown out or recycled. You should first contact your waste/recycling hauler (if applicable) to see if they are able to schedule a special pick-up time for those larger items. If not, you can reach out to a local scrap yard to see if they are interested. Auburn Transfer Station - Cayuga County residents, whether they live in the City of Auburn ($20 annual permit) or elsewhere in the County ($120 annual permit) can bring furniture and large household appliances to the Auburn Transfer Station located at 311 N Division St. The City will collect these items for a fee that ranges depending on the item.
