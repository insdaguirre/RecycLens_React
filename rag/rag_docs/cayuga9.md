Food Waste		






The term "food waste" or “wasted food” describes food that was not used for its intended purpose and is managed in a variety of ways described below. Examples include unsold food from retail stores; plate waste, uneaten prepared food, spoiled food, peels and rinds considered inedible, or kitchen trimmings from restaurants, cafeterias, and households; or by-products from food and beverage processing facilities. While the food waste problem cannot be solved by consumers alone, taking simple steps in your everyday life can make a difference in addressing this issue. 



 
 
 






 Food Waste Prevention





Preventing wasted food, or source reduction, is the top tier of the "Wasted Food Scale" (seen above). Preventing food from going to waste by growing, buying, and preparing only what is needed saves grocery money and reduces the environmental impacts of wasted food. Both businesses and individuals can learn to effectively prevent wasted food by taking simple steps such as making grocery lists, inventorying supplies, and buying only what you need.

 Food Donation & Upcycling





Donating food is in the second tier of the "Wasted Food Scale". When wholesome food is rescued, redistributed, or donated, it nourishes people and keeps food from being wasted. While Americans throw away millions of tons of food, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that in 2022, 12.8 percent of U.S. households were food insecure at some time during the year. In many cases, the food tossed into our nation’s landfills is wholesome, edible food. Most food donations come from higher up the food supply chain, such as from farmers, food manufacturers, distributors, or retailers. But schools, community organizations, and individuals can also make a difference by collecting and donating unspoiled, healthy food or participating in local food rescue efforts.

 Composting





Composting is nature’s way of recycling and is one of the most powerful actions we can take to reduce trash in landfills, address climate change, and build healthy soil. Composting is in the fourth tier of the "Wasted Food Scale". Composting can take place at many scales/sizes – backyard, community, on-farm, municipal and regional – and at a range of locations in urban to rural areas. A small-scale system can be as simple as a backyard compost pile or vermicomposting (worm composting) bin, whereas a large-scale system may be a centralized, commercial composting facility processing organic materials from around the region. Regardless of size or scale, the basic principles of composting are generally the same. The composting process requires a proper ratio of carbon-rich materials (such as dry leaves or wood chips) to nitrogen-rich materials (such as food scraps or grass clippings).Follow this LINK to learn more about the best tips and tricks for at home composting from Cornell Cooperative Extension!





 Anaerobic Digestion





Anaerobic digestion is the natural process in which microorganisms break down organic materials. Anaerobic digestion happens in closed spaces where there is no air (or oxygen). Biogas is generated during anaerobic digestion when microorganisms break down (or eat) organic materials in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is mostly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), with very small amounts of water vapor and other gases. Biogas is a renewable energy source that can be used in a variety of ways. Biogas treated to meet pipeline quality standards can be distributed through the natural gas pipeline and used in homes and businesses. Biogas can also be cleaned and upgraded to produce compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas. The material that is left after anaerobic digestion happens is called “digestate.” Digestate is a wet mixture that is usually separated into a solid and a liquid. Digestate is rich in nutrients and can be used as fertilizer for crops.
