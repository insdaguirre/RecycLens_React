It is one of the most powerful actions we can take to reduce our trash, address poor emissions, and build healthy soil. By turning our food scraps and yard trim into compost, we transform our waste streams into a beneficial, value-added soil amendment and use it to protect the environment and create resilient communities.EPA Composting at Home link:      https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home#:~:text=Maintain%20the%20proper%20ratio%20of,greasy%20foods%20to%20your%20pile.Slab City Organics link:      http://www.justgooddirt.com/index.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR7qwRVSsAVO3jj0vPLWaG-bbI9H5I_JKfeyqUfJPDxGSzo4PNRfM9znzNJPlw_aem_xOUqcrupKJsUP-abvPAUhQ Unacceptable items
