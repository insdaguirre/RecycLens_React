We hope this information is helpful in making your deliveries to our facilities as smooth as possible. 
 
Instructions for each Disposal Location: As you locate the item you are looking for, the Disposal Location 
will indicate where it is to be taken. The instructions for delivery are outlined below. All open loads must be 
tarped and tied down. 
 
GENERAL SCALE INSTRUCTIONS: Drive onto the scale when there is no other vehicle on the scale. The 
scale attendant will ask what type of materials you are delivering. Advise if it is C&D (construction 
& demolition materials), MSW (general garbage), MIXED (C&D plus MSW) or Recyclables. Let the 
attendant know if are paying by cash or check, or if you have an account. All loads must be fully 
tarped. Un-tarped loads will be rejected. 
 
"LANDFILL": Located in Lowman, just off Route 17/86, two miles east of the Wellsburg / Lowman exit. 
Deliver all materials by the load. Enter in the gate marked "Landfill". Drive up the hill to the Scale Trailer & 
check in with the scale operator. The scale operator will instruct you on how to proceed from there. When you 
enter the dumping area, the attendant will instruct you on where to unload your refuse. After unloading, proceed 
back to the scales to check out and sign your weigh ticket. Please call 529-3204 for ACCESSIBILITY Due to

GENERAL Drop Off Station (DOS) INSTRUCTIONS: The DOS sites are for the disposal of bagged 
residential garbage and residential recyclables only. Large amounts of these items must be taken 
to our Lake Street scales for disposal. Please use caution when driving into the DOS as there will 
be pedestrians in the unloading area and at the Booth. Unload your garbage, fully enclosed in our 
specially marked bags, in the container marked for garbage. Those bags are available for $4.00 each at
