"We Do NOT Accept": Items marked with this note are usually hazardous materials that we either cannot or 
do not accept and they have other disposal options. Some local haulers accept these materials. Op-Tech in 
Waverly (607-565-8891) is another option. The Semi - Annual Household Hazardous Waste Collection Days 
are available for Residents (not businesses), who may dispose of some of these items by calling the Cornell 
Cooperative Extensive office (734-4453) to register for participation in the event. See the notes in the 
Preparation column for other pertinent information. Call our office if you have questions. 
All Loads must be fully Tarped and/or Contained in Vehicle 
Items are listed in alphabetical order.  Items are sometimes listed under two different 
names, such as "automobile" and "car". If you can't locate the item you are looking 
for, try a different word that would describe the same thing…for example, you won't 
find "lawn furniture" but you will find "furniture", "aluminum", "metal" and "plastic".
