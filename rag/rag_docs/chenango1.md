Common household ingredients can be substituted for hazardous materials. Many of these substitutes are sage to use and don't pose disposal problems. While some of these ingredients are not completely nontoxic, they are less toxic than their commercial counterparts. A list of alternatives can be found on this page. No matter how hard you may try to avoid using hazardous products, sometimes there are no alternatives.The following suggestions will provide help in these situations:Purchase the least toxic products available.Read and follow the directions on how to use a product and how to dispose of the container. Be aware, that older products sometimes give instructions which are now deemed inappropriate for safe disposal.Buy only as much as you need, use up leftovers or share them with friends.Call (607) 337-1792 with questions.SubstitutesGeneral CleanersVinegar or lemon juice, full strength for tougher stains or diluted with water for regular cleaning.Scouring CleanserBaking soda as a paste or diluted with water (do not use on aluminum); or salt or Borax sprinkled on a sponge.Oven CleanerWipe up spills as soon as possible, sprinkle spills with baking soda or salt while still warm, then wipe.Drain CleanerPour 2-4 quarts of boiling water down the drain weekly or pour ½ cup baking soda and ½ cup warm white vinegar down the drain, wait 15 minutes and flush with boiling water.Toilet Bowl CleanerPour ½ cup liquid chlorine bleach in toilet bowl, let soak for ½ hour, OR use flat cola for 1 hour, scrub with brush and flush.Ant RepellentRepel with powdered red chili peppers, paprika, dried peppermint, or borax.Window CleanerMix ¼ cup vinegar in 1 quart of water, spray on and wipe dry.
