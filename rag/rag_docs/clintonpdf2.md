Please call ahead to confirm business hours and

Accepted Materials 
All PaintCare sites accept up to 5 gallons per visit (some may take more).  PaintCare sites accept house paint as 
well as primers, stains, sealers, and clear coatings such as shellac and varnish. Accepted products, also referred 
to as “PaintCare products” and “architectural coatings,” are the same ones that carry the PaintCare fee when 
purchased. To be accepted for drop-off, PaintCare products must be in their original containers of no larger than 
5 gallons in size, must have the original manufacturer’s printed label on the container, and must be covered with 
a secured lid. 
Prohibited Materials 
PaintCare sites do not accept aerosol coatings, solvents, and products designed and labeled to be used for 
industrial or non-architectural use.  Sites will not accept leaking or unlabeled containers.
