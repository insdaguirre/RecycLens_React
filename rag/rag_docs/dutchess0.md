Solid Waste Management
The Division of Solid Waste Management of the Dutchess County Department of Planning and Development formulates programs for the collection and disposal of solid waste (discarded material) generated within Dutchess County.
Our main function is to implement the Dutchess County Local Solid Waste Management Plan .
The three main goals of the plan are: 


Reducing the amount of waste generated within Dutchess County 

Increasing the amount of waste that is recycled and reused
Converting the remaining waste to electricity through waste-to-energy disposal; minimizing the use of landfill disposal

Food Repurposing Workshop in Collaboration with the Culinary Institute of America
The Dutchess County Division of Solid Waste Management collaborated with the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) to host a Food Repurposing Workshop at the CIA's New York campus. Jason Potanovich, associate dean of the school of culinary arts and 1996 CIA graduate, gave a cooking demo that taught residents about proper food safety when cooking with leftovers and the impacts of sustainable ingredients. Associate Dean Potanovich illustrated how leftovers can become delicious new meals.

America Recycles Day Art Challenge
To celebrate America Recycles Day (November 15th), the Division of Solid Waste Management continued its "America Recycles Day Art Challenge", designed for K-12 students in Dutchess County. The goal of the project was to educate young people on recycling practices while also having them reimagine materials they would otherwise throw away. Materials for each project were collected by the student, bringing attention to how much waste accumulates daily and how much can be recycled or reused.
A reception was held at the Boardman Road Library on Tuesday, November 18th where County Executive Sue Serino and NYS Senator Rob Rolison awarded winners with a certificate. All winning artwork was displayed at the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in their Henry A. Wallace Center for several weeks.
Visit our webpage to see the press release with winners' information, and our Facebook page to see photos of the reception!
