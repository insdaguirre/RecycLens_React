Helpsy
The Division of Solid Waste is expanding its textile recycling efforts by partnering with Helpsy to offer free curbside pickup to County residents in participating municipalities. Our Division of Solid Waste Management is currently reaching out to local municipalities, inviting them to join this partnership, which is scheduled to begin at the end of 2025. 
This complimentary service allows residents to schedule collection appointments on designated days, and Helpsy will come to you to pick up and responsibly recycle clothing, shoes, towels, rugs, and other textiles to help Dutchess County reduce waste and support a more sustainable future.
Local municipalities must register to be part of this program. Home pickup services will only be available in municipalities that are registered with HELPSY.  Scheduling pickup will be easy for residents in participating municipalities; they’ll simply go online at www.helpsy.com/pickup 
Curbside pickup is expected to begin in participating municipalities by the end of 2025. In the meantime, all residents can drop of textiles at Helpsy drop-off bins throughout Dutchess County. 
Drop-off Bins
Residents can also drop off textiles 24 hours a day at designated Helpsy bins at the following locations throughout Dutchess County:
