Holiday Sustainability Tips














"What do I do with my used…?”
  LIGHTS- NOT recyclable. Can be taken to an electronics recycling event / location, check Beyond the Curb or Sunnking for more information.
  WRAPPING PAPER- Wrapping paper, unless it contains foil, is recyclable! Just be sure to remove any ribbons/bows/other non-paper decoratives. Consider alternative methods of concealing your gifts, such as creating your own reusable wrapping out of canvas/fabric or working the wrapping into the gift itself (i.e.: using a dish towel as wrapping for a kitchen-themed gift)! Don't forget that brown kraft paper can be a great canvas for kids' artwork.
  FOOD- Plan your meals ahead of time to reduce food waste. Keep your excess food out of landfills by composting either at home or through a service like Farmer Pirates!
300 million pounds of excess food is wasted each Thanksgiving.
This is the estimated amount of food wasted according to the organization ReFED. Here are some tips you can use this holiday season to reduce wasted food:

Plan your meals to prepare the right amount of food for the amount of guests you are hosting (and include some extra for leftovers)
Repurpose old take-out containers to allow your guests to go home with leftovers.
Sick of the leftovers? Turn them into leftover tacos (everyone loves tacos) with a good sauce.

  GIFT PACKAGING- Take care in separating the elements of your gift packaging appropriately.

Cardboard boxes – can be recycled normally (curbside)
Plastic films (bubble wrap, bags, shrink wrap, etc.) – Cannot be put in curbside recycling bin. Must be taken to a plastic films recycling center (usually located in grocery stores or other large retailers)

Solid plastics - Check your local recycling rules. Plastics 1 and 2 accepted throughout Erie County, with some municipalities offering additional recycling opportunities. See the guide below.

(Above) Plastic types one and two, highlighted in red, are accepted for curbside recycling throughout Erie County.
Did you know? A common misconception about plastic recycling is that the "3 arrows" symbol present on most plastics actually identifies the type of plastic it is (known as an RIC, or Resin Identification Code), and doesn't necessarily indicate that it's recyclable. This confusion is thanks to the creators of the recycling symbol we all know and love failing to copyright it's use, which led plastic manufacturers to mimic it's design, intentionally creating confusion in consumers who believe they're buying a recyclable product.


  BATTERIES– Regular non-rechargeable batteries can safely be placed in the garbage or kept until a household hazardous waste collection for recycling. Rechargeable batteries should be stored in a cool dark place with both terminals taped off to prevent potential contact with other batteries. Rechargeable batteries should NEVER be put in either the garbage or recycling. They should be returned to the stores they were purchased from or to a designated drop off location so they can be recycled.

The Real Scoop on Christmas Trees:
Those who participate in Christmas festivities often find themselves in this yearly predicament: whether to purchase a real tree for decorating or to go with (or reuse last year’s) artificial tree. Like the answer to many quandaries of sustainability, both options have their own unique impacts on the planet and there exists no definitive “right answer”, but rather a better way of doing either option!

Artificial trees can be the more overall sustainable option, so long as you take the time and funds to invest in one that will last. Cheap trees lead to quicker breakage leading to less use, which not only leaves you suddenly responsible for its disposal but sends a message to its manufacturer that “people are buying the cheap trees” and to “make more immediately”! This leads to the production of yet more products designed to sell (not to last) and thus more plastic waste taking up space in our world once they inevitably break.
Real trees can also be the more sustainable option, despite the necessity of chopping them down. Real trees have the added benefit of being an entirely organic and replenishable resource, meaning that they will decompose naturally once discarded (although composting is preferable to a landfill to mitigate methane emissions) and are constantly being regrown to meet yearly demand. Purchasing a real tree also often means supporting a local small business, making it the more economically sustainable choice as it funnels your money back into your own community rather than towards a corporation.
 
General Sustainability Tips 
  QUALITY OVER QUANTITY- We all know the feeling of receiving an excess of things we have zero interest in ever using. Reduction is always the first step. Consider investing in one gift that you know will be used and enjoyed by the recipient for a long time rather than compensating with many smaller, cheaper (both in cost and build quality), and overall less meaningful gifts.
  GIFT AN EXPERIENCE- Saves on waste & ends up creating priceless memories!
  SHOP LOCAL-  Less overall waste (packaging, materials sourcing, transportation), supports small creators/businesses, unique items that cannot be found anywhere else, made with love by a real human being, potential for custom-made items, the list of benefits goes on! Small Business Saturday, traditionally celebrated the day after Black Friday, is a great opportunity to practice shopping local and explore your community.
  NO SHAME IN GIFTING USED ITEMS or MAKING GIFTS- Whether that be regifting something you already own or buying a used item. We insist that your grumpy dad would secretly really cherish this, despite what he may imply.
