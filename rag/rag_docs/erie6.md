Events & Drop-off Locations  

Visit Sunnking's webpage to find out about Special Collections Events in our area and what types of e-waste you can bring.
Listing of possible permanent Drop-offs for your E-waste. (Select electronics from the drop-down menu.)
Find out if your municipality collects electronics.
Important: By placing unwanted home computers at the curb, you offer identity thieves an opportunity to learn a lot about you. Your account numbers, passwords, and even social security number may be left behind in your electronics where dishonest people can find them. When your computer is taken to be recycled, however, your hard drive can be reformatted and all of your personal information permanently erased.

Please call locations before bringing your e-waste as they may change their rules. TVs and computer monitors are especially problematic.
Donations & Resale
If your electronics are in working order, consider listing items on Freecycle.org or other sites such as Craigslist.
E-waste Tips

Repair rather than replace. For a minimal investment, you may be able to fix a formerly reliable piece of equipment. 
Upgrade what you have, rather than buying new. Instead of purchasing a new computer, for example, consider upgrading your current one with additional memory or new accessories.
Buy a good-quality product. It may cost more up-front, but it will last longer and save you money in the long run.
Buy electronics manufactured with fewer hazardous chemicals. Products rated as EPEAT Gold, Silver, or Bronze meet certain product and manufacturer standards. These products contain less harmful materials, have more recycled-content and reduced packaging, last longer and are more energy efficient, and are easily recycled. 

Electronics Disposal, the Environment, and the Law
Most computer monitors and televisions contain about five pounds of lead. Computers also contain other elements that, if improperly disposed of, can be environmental hazards (including metals and rechargeable batteries). 
State law requires retailers of Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cad), Button and Lithium Ion batteries to accept them back for recycling. These retailers include: Best Buy, Lowes, Home Depot, Sears, Sprint, Target, Radio Shack, Batteries Plus, and Verizon Wireless. Effective Dec. 5, 2011, state law prohibits persons from knowingly disposing of most rechargeable batteries in the garbage.

Cellular phone retailers must, by NYS law, accept cell phones back for recycling or arrange for such via shipping.  
NOTE--Regular household alkaline or zinc batteries can be disposed of in the trash. For a fee-based alkaline/zinc battery recycling program, visit: www.thinkgreenfromhome.com/batteries.cfm.
