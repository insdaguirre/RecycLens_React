Can I access funding for a municipal project?Do I have a defined project; either supported in a plan or engineering report? Are you a municipality or non-profit? Or do you have a partnership with either? Are you prepared to upfront grant funds? Do you have the funding available for any match requirement? If Yes, you are ready to apply! 









Essex County Referral 239M Process
General Municipal Law 239M, N Review – under NYS General Municipal Law Section 239, municipal planning actions specified by these sections are subject to review by the Essex County Planning Board, which has been designated as the County Planning & Economic Development Committee. All Essex County municipalities entered into an agreement stating that only the following proposed actions shall be subject to referral by the towns to the County. The below actions only need a referral if the proposed project is 500′ of a municipal boundary, Agricultural District Land, or County and State roads, lands and facilities.

adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance or local law
issuance of a special use permit affecting property
approval of site plans affecting property
granting of use or area variances affecting property

All other proposed actions under consideration by the town shall be deemed to be of a local nature and therefore exempt from referral to the County, despite provisions of General Municipal Law 239M and/or 239N.
