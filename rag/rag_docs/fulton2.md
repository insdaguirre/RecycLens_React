The Fulton County Sanitary Landfill is located in the Town of Johnstown, and is situated on 720 acres of land, with 47.9 acres of active landfill that consists of 10 cells, including 1 capped cell and 1 cell that is yet to be opened. A total of 105 acres is available for actual landfill. Areas are also set aside for collecting recyclable items such as tires and metal that are then marketed to recycling companies.
Commercial customers can obtain a permit to bring debris to the landfill (see permit application). Residents are encouraged to hire permitted small haulers for larger construction projects, due to the requirements for use of the landfill. For a complete listing of the Landfill use requirements, see the Landfill Terms of Use.
