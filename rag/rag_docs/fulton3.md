SINGLE STREAM RECYCLING





 










How Does Singlestream Recycling Work?All Recyclable Items Mix Together in One Bin for CollectionAll recyclable items – paper, cardboard, plastic, metal and glass – need to be mixed together – No Sorting or Separation is Needed Lids and labels can be left on recyclable containers, which should be empty and rinsed before recycling. Recyclables must be placed in your designated recycling bin (a durable, lidded, plastic or metal container of your choice, 45 gallon maximum), 50 pound limit, marked with a DSW-issued sticker. More than one recycling bin is OK.  Do not place recyclables in plastic bags for collection (shredded paper is the only exception). No string, no bags, no trash allowed. Single Stream Recycling Brochure pdfElectronics Drop Off pdfNeedle Disposal pdf
