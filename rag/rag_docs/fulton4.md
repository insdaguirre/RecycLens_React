Once completely hardened, the material can be disposed of in regular garbage, (NOT Recycling) with the lid clearly removed, so garbage crews can tell there is no liquid contained within. This is the best way to dispose of old/bad paint.To dispose of good, reusable latex paint, please call (855) PAINT09 or visit paintcare.org for drop off site locations. Bad paint should be dried up in the can and disposed with garbage, as explained above.For questions, call the Solid Waste Department’s Recycling Info-Line at (518) 736-5504.Intended Use of Transfer StationTransfer stations are open only to residents of the municipality for their regularly generated household garbage and small quantities of remodeling waste. This is specified in both local County law and the contract between the municipality and County for the use of each station. The rule of thumb for quantity allowed for remodeling waste is the equivalent of five pick up truckloads for any one project (except Northampton, which accepts only 3 loads of remodeling debris). If a resident says they will have more than this quantity, they should be advised to hire a private hauler to handle the job. Call the Department of Solid Waste at 518-736-5501 for a list of permitted haulers in your area.LandlordsAre NOT allowed to use transfer stations to dispose of garbage from their tenants’ apartments; for clean-out of a dwelling when a tenant leaves; or in renovating an apartment house. Landlords are considered to be businesses, since they earn revenue from renters. Therefore, a landlord should be advised to tell his or her tenants to utilize existing curbside garbage collection services in the municipality where they live, or to obtain a permit for the station that serves the municipality where they rent. The Landlord may hire a hauler to bring refuse directly to the Fulton County Landfill,or may open an account with the Department of Solid Waste.License PlatesCan be recycled in the bulk metal bin at transfer stations. License plates are NOT accepted in curbside pick up programs.Liquid WasteOf any kind is NOT allowed to be disposed of at any Fulton County Solid Waste facility, including the transfer stations. (Used motor oil is considered a recyclable.)Paint must be dried up by putting cat litter, dirt, sand or sawdust in the paint until it is no longer in liquid form. To dispose of good, reusable paint, pleasec all (855) PAINT09 or visit paintcare.org for drop off sites.ManureManure may not be disposed of at any Fulton County Solid Waste facility. Manure generated by farm animals should be disposed of on site as a farm is considered a business and is not allowed the use of transfer stations. Small quantities of animal waste can be disposed of at the transfer station, but it must be contained in a bag, or sealed in some manner.MattressMattresses (and cloth-covered box springs) can be disposed of as garbage. (Metal bedsprings go into metal bin).Metal BinThe following items may be deposited in the bulk metal bin at transfer stations for recycling:ACCEPTABLEMufflers, Old pipe, Old wireCar doors, Hoods , License platesAppliances (See “Appliances” page 1)Aluminum doors, aluminum chair framesOil tanks (for furnaces) See Oil Tanks,page 9, for preparation instructions.Metal 55-gallon drums w/tops & bottomsremoved & crushedLawn mower engines with all fluids drainedUNACCEPTABLEGas tanksCar frames, TiresCar/Truck Engine partsTransmissionsPaint cans, Propane tanksCloth covered box springsFreon-containing unitsMotor OilMotor oil from lawn mowers and vehicles is acceptable for recycling at all transfer stations at no charge. Oil must be placed in a translucent jug (See-through, such as a windshield washer container) with a screw-on cap, to keep it from spilling. Used oil jugs should be handed to the attendant, who pours it into a 55-gallon drum. It is the attendant’s responsibility to hold the oil for at least 24 hours to ensure that no contaminants are in the oil, before pouring it into the drum. Residents are NOT allowed to pour oil directly into the drums! Do NOT mix thinners, antifreeze or any other automotive fluids in with the oil.Needle DisposalSee SharpsNo SmokingThere is no smoking allowed at the transfer stations, by the attendants, who are county employees. Residents are also prohibited from smoking while they dispose of garbage and recyclables and lit cigarette butts should NOT be thrown into the garbage hoppers, as there is danger of fire.Oil TanksOil tanks (fuel oil tanks for furnaces) must be empty and cut in half and flattened; or they can be drilled with numerous holes on all sides. An alternative method of disposal is to take the tank to Bornt Waste & Metal, call 518-725-6227 for information on their hours and disposal requirements.Paint – Latex & Oil Based OptionsPlease call (855) PAINT09 or visit paintcare.org for a list of drop off site locations.To dispose of small quantities of any kind of paint – completely dry up the liquid paint (in the original can) and dispose of it with regular household garbage, with the lid clearly removed. Dry the paint by removing the lid and letting the can sit until it is solidified; or bulk-up liquid paint with cat litter, sand, or sawdust, let it harden, then throw away in regular garbage, with the lid re-moved. Do not recycle paint cans in singlestream recycling.Bad oil paint or stain can be disposed of at the Household Hazardous Waste Drop-off Day, which is held every other year (See HHW Drop-off Day.) Call the Recycling Info-Line, 518-736-5504 with questions.Permit SalesAre the responsibility of the municipality served by the transfer station, per the contract between the municipality and the County. The color of the permit sticker, timing of renewal and cost of sticker are determined by the municipality, which should notify this department of the new color, price, etc. Municipalities are encouraged to ensure the permittee is the owner of a residence in that municipality, (meaning they have a residence, not just land with no structure on it,) and obtain their name, license plate number, make and model of vehicle, address and phone number. This information assists this department in identifying anyone who abuses the station rules.It is Department of Solid Waste policy that transfer station permit stickers must be permanently affixed to the vehicle listed on the application. Residents are NOT allowed to loan their sticker privileges to others. Proper display of a valid sticker assists the station attendant to ensure the station is not being abused; assists them in performing their job, and assures the municipality isn’t paying for waste that doesn’t come from within their area or from businesses.Permit Stickers, RevocationThe Director of the Department of Solid Waste through local solid waste management law, has the authority to revoke a user’s permit to utilize a transfer station for just cause. Typically, an attendant brings a problem of noncompliance, unauthorized business use, or non-resident use of a station to this department’s attention.Transfer station attendants are advised to write down the permit sticker number, license plate number, make and model of the vehicle in case of a problem, so this department can match the permit sticker with the individual. Municipal clerks, who sell the stickers and keep records of permit numbers, are helpful in identifying an abuser. Depending on the infraction, the Director may issue a warning, or revoke the permit. Revocation is done via letter, with a copy to municipal clerks and station attendants.Revocation may be permanent, or for the remainder of the year. If someone whose permit has been revoked attempts to use a station, they are turned away. In extreme circumstances, the Sheriff’s Department may be called to escort a revokee out of the station. Anyone whose permit is revoked should hire a private hauler or utilize curbside garbage pick up if offered in the municipality.PharmaceuticalsLeftover or outdated prescription and over-the-counter medicines should not be flushed down the toilet. Residents are encouraged to use the Prescription Drug Drop Box, located in the lobby of the Fulton County Sheriff’s Department on Rt. 29, Johnstown. It is no cost and available 24 hours a day. (Controlled substances and veterinary medicine are also accepted. No liquids or sharps). The Gloversville Police Department also has a drop-box in the lobby. Open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. weekdays. Most pharmacies in Fulton County have mailback programs for old medicines. An alternate disposal method is to mix the medicine with dirt, kitty litter, or coffee grounds and put it into the regular garbage. The empty pill bottles are also garbage (not recycling).Pizza BoxesClean, non-greasy pizza boxes, both corrugated and one-layer cardboard, are allowed in singlestream recycling. All food waste should be removed. Dirty boxes should go into the garbage.Plastic Grocery BagsOne-use plastic grocery bags should be deposited at grocery and retail stores. “Bags of plastic bags” (including bubble wrap and film wrap) go in specially marked bins at stores. No loose bags or “bags full of bags” are allowed in singlestream recycling. The New York State one-use plastic bag ban begins March 1, 2020, residents are encouraged to use re-useable bags.Prohibited MaterialsThe following materials are prohibited from disposal at all transfer stations:HOT ASHESCOMMERCIAL WASTELIQUID WASTEINFECTIOUS WASTEEXPLOSIVE WASTESEPTAGE & SLUDGEHAZARDOUS WASTEPROPANE TANKS (Dispose at DSW only)DEAD ANIMALSFREON UNITS (Dispose at DSW only), $5 ea. for residents. See “Freon”MEDICAL WASTETIRES (Dispose at DSW only.) Fees apply. See “Tires” Propane Tanks20-lb propane tanks (barbeque grill size) are accepted at the DSW ONLY (next to Freon units). Small 1-lb propane tanks (Coleman portable stove size) can be disposed of as garbage if EMPTY. Large propane tanks (such as 100 lb. residential tanks) should go back to the dealer.Quantities & LimitationsThe transfer stations are designed to accept weekly generated household refuse, and SMALL QUANTITIES of remodeling debris. Rule of thumb, is any one project is allowed the equivalent of five pick up truck loads.(Except Northampton, which allows only three loads).If more than that quantity will be generated, residents should be advised to hire a hauler.Recyclables (at transfer stations)Details are outlined in Department of Solid Waste brochures. Additional brochures available upon request by calling the DSW at 518-736-5504. All transfer stations accept the following material (a permit is needed for singlestream recycling or bulk metals).Singlestream Recycling - Drop-off containers for singlestream recycling are located at every transfer station. (See Singlestream for recycling preparation guidelines). Recycling can be transported in any way convenient to residents, and dumped loose into the bin at the transfer station. Residents need valid permits to recycle at transfer stations.Bulk Metals - Stoves, dishwashers, dryers, etc. (See "Bulk Metal"). A transfer station permit is needed for metal disposal. Caroga residents must purchase a coupon from municipal clerk to dispose of an appliance (see "Appliances.")Electronics and televisions - see “Computers”Textiles & Shoes - Put in textile collection boxes. See “Textiles” for expanded list.Motor Oil - Put used motor oil in a translucent jug with a tight cap, hand to station attendant (Residents DO NOT pour the oil into the 55-gallon drums themselves).Propane Tanks - 20-lb propane tanks are accepted at the Solid Waste Department ONLY. (Put next to Freon units). Small, empty 1-lb propane tanks are garbage.Rechargeable Batteries - Residents can bring rechargeable batteries and button batteries and dispose of them in special containers at each transfer station (in with electronics).Vehicle Batteries - Place in designated location at each transfer station. Or encourage residents to turn in their batteries for the rebate at stores that sell vehicle batteries.Recycling Law“Source Separation” or recycling, has been mandatory in Fulton County since 1992. This means that recyclables previously noted, CANNOT be included in with garbage. It is a Transfer Station Attendant’s job to look at both garbage bags and recyclables to ensure adherence to both recycling and garbage disposal guidelines. The more residents recycle, the less they pay through their local taxes, and it lengthens the life of the Fulton County Landfill.Refrigerators/FreezersFreon containing units (refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and dehumidifiers) are not accepted at transfer stations. They may be disposed of only at the Fulton County Department of Solid Waste, 847 Mud Road, Johnstown. There is a $5 disposal fee (residential). See FreonResidencyOut of County waste is NOT permitted to come to the transfer stations. Municipalities selling permit stickers should make every effort to ascertain that a permit applicant is a resident of their municipality (meaning they have a residence in that municipality, not just land with no structure on it.)Scavenging ProhibitedOnce deposited at a County owned facility such as the transfer station, all materials become the property of the County. Residents are NOT allowed to take items from transfer stations, and are NOT allowed to climb into any container to retrieve anything. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS!County ownership is noted in the County’s local solid waste law, and there is liability on the part of the County if someone were to get hurt trying to retrieve an item out of any county container.Sharps (Syringe & Needle Disposal)There are several safe, approved methods of disposal for used needles, syringes and lancets. Palmer’s Pharmacy in Johnstown participates in the “Project Needle Smart” program. A free 1 quart container or miniholder is given on request, and the store has an anonymous drop-off kiosk to deposit the container when filled. (Sharps disposal containers can also be purchased at all pharmacies).Filled containers can also be dropped off at the Fulton Center for Rehabilitation and Health Care, 847 County Highway 122, Johnstown. Call the facility at 518-773-3400 for drop-off information. An alternate method is to place needles in a rigid plastic container, (such as a liquid laundry detergent bottle) and tape the top closed with duct tape and PUT IT IN THE GARBAGE.A PLASTIC JUG WITH NEEDLES SHOULD NEVER GO IN WITH RECYCLABLES!ShinglesCan be disposed of at transfer stations, but refer to QUANTITY AND LIMITATIONS (page 12), for the equivalent of 5 pick-up truck loads (except Northampton, which allows 3 loads) for a home improvement project. If the quantity will be greater than five loads worth, resident should be advised to hire a private hauler. Call the Department of Solid Waste for a list of local permitted haulers. Station attendants are within their job duties to request the loads be spaced out and not be brought on the same day, so the garbage hoppers do not become overfull.Shredded PaperShredded paper (from a paper shredder) should go into a clear plastic bag. This bag should be included with (loose) singlestream recycling. Put the tied bag (of shredded paper) into recycling containers at transfer stations.
