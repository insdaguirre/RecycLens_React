The GLOW Committee was created in 1987 as a cooperative effort between the Counties of Genesee, Livingston, Orleans and Wyoming whose purpose was to develop strategies for the management of solid waste in the region. Orleans County ended its affiliation with the GLOW at the end of 2003.
Mission:
GLOW is an Inter-County agency that provides leadership in solid waste issues for residents, businesses, and municipalities. GLOW's leadership includes education, resources, and direct services.
