Our goal is to accept and efficiently dispose of the municipal solid waste stream, including construction and demolition debris, and to process and market the source-separated recyclables generated by the county’s residents and businesses.
When you Dispose in Greene, your tipping fees support a full service Solid Waste Management program, covering municipal solid waste, construction and demolition debris, household hazardous waste collection, and a full recycling program. Our transfer stations system provides an easy, efficient, and low cost alternative to hiring a garbage hauler. Do it yourself drop off of your trash and recyclables saves you money and keeps jobs in Greene County. We also accept those hard to dispose of items like furniture, mattresses, refrigerators, tires, and electronics. Details and rates for acceptance

Help Greene Grow Green
Greene County Solid Waste Management seeks to reduce food waste and the impact it has on our environment. This is a FREE program to eliminate non-wasteful food products from our landfill.
Greene County Solid Waste Management has purchased the EcoRich machine for our Catskill Transfer station to turn food waste into finished compost. Residents are encouraged to bring a bucket from home and get some for your own personal use!

Tarp it or Ticket!
Did you know that it is ILLEGAL in New York State to transport your waste without properly tarping it?
Not only is it required by law, but tarping your waste helps keep our roads clean and prevents trash from flying out of your vehicle while you’re transporting it.
When you are transporting your waste to the Greene County Transfer Stations, please make sure to securely tarp all your trash before hitting the road.
Remember, there will be fines imposed if this practice persists, so please ensure compliance for the well-being of our community.
Let’s work together to keep our roadways and community clean.
Thank you for your cooperation.
