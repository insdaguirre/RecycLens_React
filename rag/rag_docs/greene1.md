 Accepted Waste
Waste Transfer StationsAccepted WasteHelp Greene Grow GreenDisposing of Lithium BatteriesView MoreHousehold Hazardous WasteSolid Waste Rates 
All transfer stations accept bagged household trash, municipal solid waste (MSW), and construction and demolition debris (C&D). Each station also takes recycling. Yard waste is not accepted.
Salvation Army donations are accepted at receptacles at each of our transfer stations.
 
Trashed batteries start fires!
DO NOT mix lithium batteries in with your trash.  Store them in a refrigerator or in a cool, dry place until you can drop them off to be recycled. Greene County Solid Waste Transfer Stations are official drop-off points for lithium batteries. So are Lowe’s, Home Depot, & Staples.
