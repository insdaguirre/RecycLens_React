 Household Hazardous Waste

Household hazardous waste should not be disposed of as everyday trash. It requires special handling, processing, and disposal. Some of these materials may be recycled but are not part of our regular recycling program.
Upcoming Hazardous Waste Collection Event
Our next collection event is planned for Summer 2026. Continue to check our website for updates!
What is Household Hazardous Waste?
Household hazardous wastes (HHW) are products or chemicals that are flammable, toxic, corrosive, or chemically reactive. Look for labels such as: Warning, Caution, Danger, Poisonous, Toxic, or Flammable. Never put these items in the trash or pour chemicals down the drain. When improperly managed, hazardous wastes can pollute the environment, start fires at solid waste facilities or in homes, and cause serious injuries.
Always carefully read the label and follow all directions for using and storing chemicals and other hazardous materials. Always wear gloves when handling chemicals, including common household cleaning products. Keep items in their original containers, and avoid mixing chemicals together. Do not use chemicals for purposes other than their intended uses.
How Can I Dispose of Household Hazardous Waste?
While HHW is not regularly accepted at our waste transfer stations, Greene County does have an annual HHW Collection Event. Participants are advised to carefully separate and package their HHW to prevent leakage in their vehicles during transportation to the event. We request that there be only one occupant per vehicle with no children or pets while transporting hazardous waste. Wastes from multiple households may be combined in one vehicle, as long as they are safely packaged.  Please be prepared for the possibility of a wait in line. Documentation of residency such as a driver’s license or utility bill will be required, site security and traffic control will be provided by the Greene County Sheriff’s Department.
Under the terms of the program, this event is for household hazardous waste only. Commercial or agricultural wastes will not be accepted. Solid Waste Management staff will determine if any waste or excessive amount of waste is unacceptable.
