NOTE: Items covered under New York State’s Electronic Equipment and Telephone Recycling Acts DO NOT include most electronic household appliances (microwave ovens, refrigerators), digital cameras, radios, calculators, GPS devices, power tools, medical equipment, or batteries. Though they do not qualify as e-waste, they may still have special disposal rules.
Disposal Options

To get rid of e-waste, you must:

Find a retail or non-profit drop-off location accepting e-waste near you
Attend a Community E-Waste Event
Visit a Special Waste Drop-Off site
Bring it to a SAFE Disposal event
Enroll in ecycleNYC (apartment buildings with 10 or more units)
Use a manufacturer’s takeback program

Businesses and Nonprofits
Small businesses (fewer than 50 full time employees) and nonprofits (fewer than 75 full time employees) are eligible for free electronics recycling provided by manufacturers. Find out more about manufacturer recycling programs.
Larger businesses must hire an electronic waste recycler. Find out more about electronics handling of businesses.
Schools
Schools must follow specific guidelines for disposal of e-waste. For more information on electronics disposal for NYC DOE Schools, contact WasteSupport@schools.nyc.gov.
NYC Agencies
NYC mayoral agencies are required to contract with a private vendor for safe handling of harmful or hazardous waste. Find out more about the City's Agency Safe Handling contract.
