Harmful Household Products
Household Chemicals and Highly Corrosive Liquids
Some household and gardening products are toxic and require careful disposal. This can include:

Cleaning products and disinfectants
Cosmetic products (nail polish, hair dye)
Detergents and bleach
Drain cleaners
Furniture and floor polish
Hand sanitizer
Oven cleaner
Pest control products and bug spray

"DANGER - Corrosive" and "DANGER - Flammable"
Check bottle or container. For products labeled "DANGER - Corrosive" or "DANGER - Flammable": 

Do not pour down the drain or toilet.
Dry out any remaining product with kitty litter, newspaper, or other absorbent material, and place in trash.
Double-bag the empty container and mark it, "Danger–not for recycling," then place in regular trash.

Other Household Chemicals
For other household chemicals not labeled "DANGER - Corrosive" or "DANGER - Flammable":

Do not pour down the drain or toilet.
Use up the product and dry out any remaining liquid with kitty litter, newspaper, or other absorbent material. 
Recycle the empty container with your metal, glass, and plastic. 

You can also bring household chemicals to an upcoming SAFE Disposal Event.
Paint
Latex, Non-latex, and Spray Paint
For small amounts of paint, let dry, or use kitty litter, newspaper, or other absorbent material to soak up paint and place in trash.
For empty, dry paint cans, set out with your recycling the night before your regular recycling collection day.
Cans of leftover and unused paint can be recycled. Find a retailer with a take-back program near you, or bring to a Special Waste Drop-Off Site or SAFE Disposal Event.
For paint tubes, place in trash. Tubes are not recyclable.
PaintCare
PaintCare is a nonprofit organization created by the paint industry to manage leftover paint in accordance with local stewardship laws.
They offer drop-off sites throughout the city where residents, businesses, agencies, and nonprofits can take leftover paint for recycling.
Items should be in original containers with original manufacturer labels, lids tightly secured.
Do not bring:

Mixed paint
Leaky containers
Dry paint
Empty paint cans

Products accepted include house paint, primers, stains, sealers, and clear coatings like shellac and varnish. Find out more about accepted products.
Find a drop-off site to recycle leftover paint. Contact site for hours, availability, and restrictions.
NOTE: Most PaintCare sites will take up to 5 gallons per visit, though some will take more.
Large Volume Pickups
PaintCare offers free pickup service for 100 gallons or more of leftover paint (by container size, not liquid volume). Painting contractors, property managers, and other businesses with large amounts of leftover architectural paint can request an appointment for free pickup.
Learn more about PaintCare's large volume pickup (LVP) service.
Skin Lightening Products
Some skin lightening creams and medicated soaps contain harmful levels of mercury and require special disposal.
Even if mercury is not listed as an ingredient, many skin bleaching, fading, evening, brightening, and whitening cosmetics contain toxic amounts of mercury.
DO NOT dispose of skin lightening products with trash or recycling.
To get rid of mercury-containing cosmetic and beauty products, you can:

Visit a Special Waste Drop-off site
Bring them to a SAFE Disposal event

Learn more about mercury in soaps and creams.
