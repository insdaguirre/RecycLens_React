Metal, Glass, Plastic, and Cartons
You can recycle metal, glass jars and bottles, rigid plastics (the recycling number on the package doesn't matter), and cartons together in labeled bin with a secure lid or a clear plastic bag.
NOTE: Empty, rinsed containers are easier to process and less attractive to rodents and roaches
Metal
You can recycle all kinds of metal. This includes aluminum foil and trays, metal caps and lids, metal coffee pods, empty aerosol and paint cans, wire hangers, pots and pans, and metal hardware. Mostly-metal furniture and small appliances can be set out on your recycling day (remove/cut cables, wires and cords – put these in trash).
Glass
You can recycle glass bottles and jars. DO NOT recycle drinking glasses, eyeglasses, glass furniture, mirrors, or light bulbs.
Plastic
You can recycle most rigid plastics (items that are relatively inflexible and maintain their shape or form when bent). This includes food and drink containers, caps and lids,  cups and bowls, toys (batteries removed), consumer packaging, and acetate boxes. Mostly-plastic furniture and appliances can be set out on your recycling day (remove/cut cables, wires and cords – put these in trash).
Cartons
You can recycle beverage and liquid food cartons like milk and soup cartons and juice boxes. These are lined with a plastic film to make them leak-proof, and the plastic layer can be removed and recycled.
NOTE: DO NOT recycle these containers with your mixed paper.
What Cannot Be Recycled
Most items that cannot be recycled can be thrown in the trash.

Bowling balls and any sports balls
Cassettes, CDs, and VHS tapes
Condiment packets
Dishes, cups, and mugs (ceramics, glassware, pottery)
Face masks and disposable gloves
Foam products (Styrofoam, packing peanuts)
Glass windows and mirrors
Ice cream tubs
Markers and crayons
Plastic tubes and pouches (toothpaste tubes, fruit pouches)
Soft plastics (plastic bags, bubble wrap, plastic mailing envelopes, candy and snack wrappers)
Tanglers (cables, wires, extension cords, string lights, garden hoses, window blinds)
Wooden furniture and any items made of wood

Some materials MUST be disposed of separately.

Lithium-ion and other non-alkaline batteries
Medical waste, sharps, and containers holding discarded sharpes
Anything labeled hazardous or flammable (cigarette and butane gas lighters, fuel tanks)
Refrigerators and air conditioners
Electronics/e-waste
