Residential Waste Containerization
New York City is finally removing the mountains of black bags from our streets, reclaiming public space and improving quality of life.
New rules are in effect for properties with 1-9 residential units, as well as special-use buildings receiving DSNY collection – including City agencies, nonprofits, houses of worship, and professional offices in residential buildings.
NYC is moving towards containerizing ALL residential trash. Find out what's next for properties with 10+ residential units.

Residential Properties with 1-9 Units
As of November 12, 2024, all properties with 1-9 residential units are required to use bins, 55 gallons or less, with secure lids for trash set out.
If you already use a bin with a secure lid that is 55 gallons or less for trash set out, you may continue to use it until June 2026. After that, you will need to switch to the Official NYC Bin.
Learn more about NYC Bin requirements.
Official NYC Bins
The NYC Bin is the next step in New York City's plan to get the black trash bags off the streets and make our city cleaner and safer for all New Yorkers.
Unveiled on July 8, 2024, the NYC Bin is the official trash bin for properties with 1-9 residential units. Separate NYC Bins are available for recycling and composting as well, but are not required.
The NYC Bin is available for purchase at a significantly lower price than similar bins at retail stores, at www.bins.nyc or by calling 1-855-NYC-BINS.
NYC Bins are exclusively available for NYC property owners and building managers and will only be delivered to addresses within the five boroughs.
The NYC Bin was selected following the City's release of an RFP in October 2023 to contract a vendor to produce official NYC Bins. In the RFP, DSNY mandated that the vendor produce bins according to specifications including, but not limited to:

Cost no more than $50 for the most common size
Available in multiple sizes to accommodate different types of buildings.
Rat resistant, easy to use by sanitation workers, and compatible with mechanized collection trucks.

DSNY collection trucks will include mechanical tippers compatible with the new bins. Two sanitation workers will be needed to operate the mechanism, and this change will not affect DSNY workforce numbers.
NYC Bin Rebate
Owners of one- or two-family homes who receive the Basic or Enhanced School Tax Relief (STAR or E-STAR) credit or exemption will receive a check to pay for the cost of their official NYC Bin. The New York City Department of Finance will automatically send checks to eligible homeowners. Read more about the NYC Bin rebates.
Residential Properties with 10+ Units
NYC is also planning to containerize trash in larger residential properties.
Properties with 31 or more residential units will be required to use stationary, on-street containers for their trash, serviced by DSNY's new automated side-loading garbage trucks. On-street containers will be assigned to a specific building, solely for residents of that building.
Properties with 10 to 30 units will be able to choose between stationary on-street containers and individual trash bins.
