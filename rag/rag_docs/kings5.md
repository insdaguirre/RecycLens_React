Automotive Waste
Antifreeze
Antifreeze is hazardous waste — it is toxic to humans and poisonous to animals. Never pour antifreeze into the street, and do not pour down household drains, in sewers, or into waterways.
Empty antifreeze containers can be recycled with metal, glass, plastic, and cartons. Dry out antifreeze using kitty litter, newspaper, or other absorbent material before discarding empty containers.
You can bring unused antifreeze back to some gas or service stations — check first to see if they will accept it. 
Unused antifreeze can be brought to a DSNY SAFE Disposal Event or you can contact a hazardous material or chemical waste disposal company.
Car Batteries
It is illegal to discard these batteries with trash or recycling. This type of battery can cause fires in our collection trucks and facilities — causing harm to our workers.
You can return automotive batteries to any service station or auto supply store that sells them or bring to a DSNY Special Waste Drop-Off Site or SAFE Disposal Event.
NOTE: New York State law requires businesses that sell new lead-acid (auto) batteries to accept used ones for recycling FREE OF CHARGE (up to two used batteries per month from anyone, regardless of whether they purchase a new lead-acid battery).
Learn more about NYS requirements for returning lead-acid batteries.
Gasoline
Gasoline is highly flammable and should NEVER be disposed of in the trash or recycling. Do not pour down household drains, in sewers, or into waterways
Contact a private hazardous waste company or bring unused gasoline to a SAFE Disposal Event.
Motor Oil and Transmission Fluid
It is illegal to discard used motor oil or transmission fluid in the trash or recycling, on the ground, or into sewers and waterways.
Service stations that change oil must accept up to five gallons of used motor oil (including transmission fluid) per day, per person, at no charge. Motor oil is also accepted at Special Waste Drop-Off Sites and SAFE Disposal Event.
NOTE: New York State Law requires many businesses that sell new motor oil to accept used oil from residents FREE OF CHARGE. 
Learn more about NY State used oil regulations.
Tires
It is illegal to place car tires in the trash. However, it is ok to set out bicycle tires with your trash.
You can bring tires to any business that sells them. New York State law requires businesses that sell tires to take back used tires for recycling. These businesses include tire shops, auto parts stores, vehicle repair shops, new car dealerships.
Learn more about NY State waste tire regulations.
Residents may dispose of up to four (4) car tires at a Special Waste Drop-Off Site.
DSNY District Garages will also accept up to four (4) car tires Monday through Saturday, 10:00 AM - 5:30 PM, except holidays.
DSNY facilities will accept tires from NYC residents with a valid New York State driver's license and a valid New York State vehicle registration both with New York City addresses — no commercial vehicles allowed.
Vehicles
It is illegal to abandon a vehicle on public property. Find out more about abandoned vehicles.
You can legally dispose of vehicles — including cars, trucks, trailers, recreational vehicles (RVs), boats, motorcycles, and bicycles — by donating them (some charities will pick them up), selling them, or trading them in. You can also have them taken to a junkyard or scrap yard.
Find out more about disposing of bicycles and electric bikes and scooters.
