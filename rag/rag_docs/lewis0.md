 PaintCare Program 2025 Lewis County has partnered with the Development Authority of the North Country and PaintCare to provide the opportunity for county residents to dispose of unwanted or leftover paint for free. On the third Thursday of each month (April through November), from 8:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., residents can bring their unwanted paint to the Lewis County Transfer Site in Lowville, where it will be collected for recycling. These take-back events are for residents only. Businesses can reach out to PaintCare directly to arrange for large-scale pickups.
