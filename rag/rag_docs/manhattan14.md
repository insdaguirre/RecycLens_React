Ink and Toner Cartridges
You can put ink and toner cartridges in the trash.
Do not put them with your curbside recycling. These cartridges contain plastic, metal, and chemicals, and can be problematic to recycle.
Many companies offer take-back or mail-back programs for empty inkjet and toner cartridges from printers and copiers. Check manufacturers and local office supply stores for recycling programs.
