Light Bulbs
Dispose of light bulbs (incandescent, LED, compact fluorescent/CFL) with your trash. Double bag for safety.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFL) contain minimal amounts of mercury. While you can put these bulbs in the trash, you can also bring them to a DSNY Special Waste Drop-Off Site or SAFE Disposal Event. Some retailers, including many large hardware store chains, will take back CFLs.
