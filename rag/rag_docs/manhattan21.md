Oils, Grease, and Fats
Cooking Oil and Grease
Do not pour cooking oil or grease down sinks, toilets, or any drains.
Cooking oil and grease can clog pipes and cause sewage backups.
Let oil and grease cool, then pour into a container, seal, and dispose of with your trash. You can wipe off remaining oil or grease with a paper towel.
Greasy Foods and Food-Soiled Paper
You can put greasy foods and food-soiled paper - like pizza boxes and paper plates – with your Curbside Composting.
Excess oil can be put in a sealed container and disposed with trash.
Shortening and Rendered Fat
You can dispose of small amounts of vegetable shortening, butter, margarine, and rendered fats – like lard, schmaltz, and tallow – with your Curbside Composting.
Larger quantities and containers of shortening and animal fats can be disposed of directly in the trash.
Grease Disposal for Businesses
Commercial kitchens are required to install grease interceptors to capture fat, oil, and grease, and fat from sinks, floor drains, and other fixtures.
Learn more about disposing of grease as a business.
Wet Wipes
Dispose of ALL wet wipes with your trash – even ones that say "flushable."
Wet wipes do not break up in NYC’s sewer system. Instead, they combine and congeal with other personal hygiene produces and grease to form “fatbergs,” which lead to sewer back-ups, broken pipes, and damaged treatment plant equipment.
Learn more about the dangers of fatbergs.
