COVID-19 Test Kits
Several things can be done with expired Covid-19 test kits: 
Check to see if your COVID-19 Test Kit has a NEW EXPIRATION DATE!
In some cases, the expiration date for a  COVID-19 home test has been extended. An extended expiration date means the manufacturer provided data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.
Locate the Lot Number on your home test kit and then use the links below to find out if the expiration date has been changed:

BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test
Carestart COVID-19 Antigen Home Test
Flowflex COVID-19 Antigen Home Test
iHealth COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test
All other home tests

Per the NYS Department of Health: Covid-19 test kits are not Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) and can be placed in regular household trash for disposal.
