THE PROPER WAY TO DISPOSE OF……
Batteries (alkaline) - Accepted at the Montgomery County Transfer Stations as part of the electronics 
recycling program.  As an alternative they can be thrown in the regular trash.  Since January 1992 
many alkaline batteries are manufactured with no mercury added.  These types of batteries (AA, AAA, 
C & D) are classified by the federal government as non-hazardous and safe for disposal in your 
regular household trash.
Aerosol Cans - Recycle, if empty and have not contained hazardous material.  If empty and did 
contain hazardous material - trash.  If currently contains hazardous material residents can bring to the 
County's Household Hazardous Waste Collection Day.  
Air Conditioners - Accepted at the transfer stations.  The freon is removed by a certified individual, 
then the metal is recycled.  
Ballasts - If manufactured prior to 1979 ballasts are considered hazardous.  Residents can bring to 
the County's Household Hazardous Waste Collection Day.  If manufactured after 1979 metal ballasts 
can be disposed of in the scrap metal.  Plastic ballasts are acceptable as regular garbage.
Antifreeze - Residents can bring to the County's Household Hazardous Waste Collection Day.  Check 
with your local automobile service station to see if they have a recycling program. 
Appliances - Substantially made of metal is considered scrap metal and accepted at the Montgomery 
County Transfer Stations.  Freon containing appliances, such as dehumidifiers, have a per unit fee.  
Large freon containing appliances, such as refrigerators, need to have the door(s) removed.  The 
freon is removed by a certified individual, then the metal is recycled.  If the appliances are mostly 
plastic they are considered trash.  If the items are in working condition consider donation to local 
service agencies or thrift shops.  
Asbestos (friable) - Hazardous - not accepted.  This type of asbestos can be crumbled, pulverized 
or reduced to a powder by hand pressure when dry.  This is hazardous waste and not acceptable at 
the Montgomery County Transfer Stations.   A certified asbestos remover and disposal facility are 
required.
Asbestos (non-friable) - This type of asbestos is hard, brittle (like vinyl asbestos tile). It is acceptable 
at the Montgomery County Transfer Stations as construction and demolition debris.
Barrels - Can be disposed as trash after both ends are cut off to ensure they no longer hold any 
water, as required by landfills.
