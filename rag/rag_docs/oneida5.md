							House Hazardous Waste FAQ
						


How do I dispose of my insulin needles?Watch video answerPlace used needles in a puncture proof container such as a detergent container. Seal the detergent container and label NON-RECYCLABLE SHARPS. Place container in garbage. DO NOT PLACE WITH RECYCLABLES.Can I place my paint cans in the garbage?Yes. Only empty paint cans or cans with hardened paint can be placed in the garbage. You must remove all covers before you place them in the garbage. Any liquid paint may be brought to the EcoDrop Utica.What do I do with asbestos insulation material from my home?Non-friable asbestos from residents such as siding and shingles are classified as construction and demolition debris and may be disposed of as such. (Non-friable asbestos is asbestos that can not be crumbled or crushed by hand pressure.) Friable asbestos generated by residents should be double bagged and placed with solid waste for collection by your solid waste hauler. Multi-family dwellings, businesses, commercial establishments, industries or institutions that generate friable asbestos should contact the New York State Department of Labor at (315) 479-3215 before any removal.What do I do with propane tanks?All propane tanks (1 lb. to 100 lbs.) should be brought to the EcoDrop in Utica or Rome. Empty propane tanks can also be disposed of at your Propane Gas Vendor.What do I do with my household batteries?Watch video answerUnder the "New York State Rechargeable Battery Law" signed by the governor in December 2010, it is now illegal to toss rechargeable batteries in the trash in New York State. The New York State Rechargeable Battery Law requires battery collection by both local retailers and direct sellers of rechargeable batteries. All rechargeable batteries such as Nickel Cadmium should be brought to the Authority's Household Hazardous Waste Management Facility for proper recycling and disposal. These batteries are accepted from residents at no charge. Auto batteries are also accepted for recycling at the Authority's Household Hazardous Waste Facility at no charge.Alkaline batteries should be placed in your trash for disposal. Previously, alkaline battery disposal posed environmental threat because of the mercury content. Since mercury has been phased out of battery production, single-use alkaline battery disposal has become simpler and safer and such items should be placed with your trash. What do I do with my driveway sealer cans? Empty or hardened driveway sealer cans should be disposed of in the garbage. Liquid driveway sealer cans may be brought to the EcoDrop Utica during the months of April through September. What do I do with my old scrap tires? Watch video answerCheck with your local municipality or solid waste hauler for proper waste tire collection information. Your tires can also be delivered to the EcoDrops in Utica and Rome. Check the fee schedule for current disposal price information. Individuals interested in delivering large volumes of tires should contact the office at 733-1224 or e-mail ohswa@ohswa.org for more information. How do I dispose of fluorescent light bulbs? Watch video answerIt is legal for homeowners to dispose of fluorescent bulbs with their household trash. However, due to the mercury in these bulbs, we encourage homeowners to save them and deliver them to the EcoDrop Utica at no charge. Bulbs collected through the program are processed and mercury is recovered preventing release to the environment.
