							Electronics Recycling
						


Beginning January 1, 2015, the New York State Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act will prohibit all households and generators of electronic waste from disposing of electronic waste such as computers, computer components, televisions and other electronic devices as garbage.Since 2003, the Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority has offered a free drop-off program for electronics recycling to residents and businesses in the two-County region.Electronic waste CANNOT be placed in your curbside recycling container.Options For Recycling Unwanted Electronics:
Residents should contact their municipality or waste hauler for electronic waste collection options.
Donate or sell unwanted, working electronics.
Residents and businesses may deliver unwanted electronic waste to the Authority's Utica and Rome EcoDrops year-round, at no charge for proper recycling. Businesses and institutions must schedule an appointment prior to delivery by calling 315-733-1224.
Consider options for trading mobile devices for cash through Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and websites such as Gazelle.com.

 Many electronics contain elements such as lead, mercury and cadmium that are considered safe when the items are used as directed, but can be hazardous if disposed of with household trash and compacted at landfills. If improperly handled, these toxins can be released into the environment, posing a threat to human health. After the Authority accepts electronic waste, it is sent to a registered electronics dismantler who will separate the electronics into various raw materials such as plastic, glass, steel, copper, lead, gold and aluminum for recycling and reuse. EcoDrop BrochureElectronics Recycling VideoThe Authority Accepts the Following Electronics for Recycling:
