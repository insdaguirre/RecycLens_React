							Rechargeable Batteries
						


RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES: Under the "New York State Rechargeable Battery Law" signed by the governor in December 2010, it is now illegal to toss rechargeable batteries in the trash in New York State. The New York State Rechargeable Battery Law requires battery collection by both local retailers and direct sellers of rechargeable batteries. Under this law, no person shall knowingly dispose of rechargeable batteries as solid waste at any time in the State. Rechargeable batteries contained in electronic products must be removed prior to disposal of such products.Rechargeable batteries contain toxic metals that can be released into the environment when not managed correctly. Rechargeable batteries covered by this law include batteries for lap tops, cameras, cell phones, and rechargeable alkaline batteries.If a person should dispose of rechargeable batteries as solid waste, they shall face fines. Any retailer who violates the law shall be liable for a civil penalty.RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO THE AUTHORITY'S UTICA OR ROME ECODROPS FOR PROPER RECYCLING & DISPOSAL:Rechargeable batteries include lithium ion, lead acid, nickel cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, & lithium ion polymer batteries.These types of rechargeable can be found in household items such as electronic devices, medical devices, remote control toys, power tools, vacuums, chain saws, lawn mowers & more.ALL types of lithium batteries (single use and rechargeable) require special disposal and should be brought to the Authority or one of the locations below.ALKALINE BATTERIES:Household alkaline batteries should be placed in your trash for disposal. Previously, alkaline battery disposal posed environmental threat because of the mercury content. Since mercury has been phased out of battery production, single-use alkaline battery disposal has become simpler and safer and such items should be placed with your trash.Here is a list of locations in which you can drop-off your rechargeable batteries at no cost:
