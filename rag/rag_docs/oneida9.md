City of Utica Blue Bags & Garbage Set-out requirements
This information is for City of Utica residents on how to set out garbage & recyclables properly to the curb. Please take time to read this information. This is our City, and by following the rules and regulations we can help keep our City clean.
Garbage (City of Utica Blue Bags) and Recyclables (Orange Container/RecycleOne Decaled Container) should be placed between the sidewalk and the curb for collection.
Garbage and Recyclables are collected once a week. Set-out time is between 5 PM and 11 PM on the night before your collection day. It's against local laws to put items out except on that night. (Non-compliance may result in a violation notice.) Please remove your recycling containers and trash cans from the City curb after collection.
Each single family home is allowed to set out a maximum of 10 City of Utica blue bags each week.
Each multiple family (two or more) home and business is allowed to set out 20 City of Utica blue bags each week.










Any item that cannot be recycled and is not considered a trash or bulk item should be placed in a City of Utica blue bag.View a list of City of Utica blue bag vendors.
