Electronics












OCRRA cannot accept electronics at any of our locations, nor do we host collection events. However, elected officials in the area occasionally host free drop-off events that are unaffiliated with OCRRA. While we do not manage those registrations, OCRRA is happy to share announcements for your convenience on our regularly updated Events page.
There’s no need to wait for a collection event. Recent updates to a statewide law create a path for manufacturers to cover costs associated with collecting unwanted electronics from households. Collection sites partnering with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation offer free-drop off services.
The companies below do not report to OCRRA and may not notify the Agency of changes in policy. Some locations DO NOT accept all types of electronics covered under NYS Law. For example, they may not accept TVs or may charge a fee to accept them. Review the details closely. It is strongly advised that you call ahead to ask if your item is accepted at the following locations and if there are handling fees, restrictions or preparation requirements for drop-offs.

Recycling Options for HOUSEHOLDS
You may also contact the manufacturer of your electronics directly to learn about their take-back program. Another option is to consult the Electronics Take-Back Coalition’s list of manufacturer recycling programs or utilize Sunnking Electronics’ take-back program.
To stay up-to-date on electronics recycling, sign up for OCRRA’s monthly emails.
Wherever you dispose of an old computer or mobile device, it is a good idea to protect your personal information so it does not fall into someone else’s hands. “Wipe” your device or destroy your hard drive before recycling your old electronics.
When dropping electronics off to ANY location, it is important to find out what is happening to your materials, so you can be assured they are being handled in an environmentally friendly manner.
If you have electronics, in good working condition, an alternate disposal option is to offer them for free to the local community for reuse. Try an online material exchange site. Check out the sites listed here and give your electronics a new home!


Cell Phones
Need to get rid of a cell phone? The NYS Wireless Telephone Recycling Act requires suppliers/sellers of wireless telephone service to provide reuse or recycling for up to 10 cell phones or to provide free shipping to a recycling program. Find more information about requirements for service providers on the NYS DEC’s site. OCRRA also provides phone disposal guidance through our searchable database.
Batteries?
Need to dispose of a battery from your electronic device? Is it damaged or defective? Batteries never belong in your home recycling bin. Rechargeable batteries don’t belong in your trash or recycling bins, where they can cause fires. Visit our Battery Management Page for guidance.
