Paint and Household Toxics
Dropping off household toxics and paint items? If you have both, make a free drop-off appointment through OCRRA to bring them to Miller Environmental Group, 532 State Fair Blvd. Syracuse, NY (off Hiawatha Blvd.). DO NOT show up without making an appointment or you may be charged for your materials as a private customer of Miller Environmental Group. OCRRA’s free drop-off program requires an appointment. In your appointment confirmation email, you’ll receive instructions how to prepare your items.




		Make an Appointment	



Monday: 8am to 3pmThursday: 8am to 3pmFriday: 8am to 3pmThe first Saturday of every month: 8am to noon


Please wait until you have at least a box full of toxics ready for drop-off before making an appointment. This program is free to residents. However, OCRRA pays a flat fee for each appointment, regardless of the number of household toxics you bring. Residents are allowed two appointments annually. Help keep costs down by bringing items in bulk, so we can continue to offer this essential service at no charge.
Ask friends or neighbors if they have items you can bring in for them. While you collect them, store items in a safe area, away from children and pets.
Business materials (toxics) are not accepted under OCRRA’s household toxics program. Review the NYSDEC’s hazardous waste management guide for small businesses. 
Residents of the Town and Village of Skaneateles are NOT eligible for this toxics program as they are not part of the OCRRA service area.

Waterproofing concrete/masonry/wood sealers and repellents (not tar or bitumen-based)
Metal coatings, rust preventatives
Field and lawn paints

Containers that are leaking or empty, and containers without the original printed manufacturer’s label are not accepted. If you do not see your paint-related item listed here, contact PaintCare at 1-855-PAINT09 (1-855-724-6809) or [email protected] to see if it is acceptable.

If you are only dropping off paint, stain, waterproofing or other accepted PaintCare products, visit any PaintCare drop-off site. Each site has its own hours and volume limits, but all drop-offs are free. Find the location closest to you and follow instructions for that site. For questions about PaintCare, call 1-855-PAINT09 (1-855-724-6809) or email [email protected] for details.
