How Do I Get Rid Of Appliances?
















#1 - Recycle





These items never belong in a curbside recycling bin. However, small household appliances may be dropped off at Bruin Recycling in Liverpool for recycling; check their website or contact them in advance to confirm they will take your item.
If the item contains a battery, remove it and follow guidance on OCRRA’s Battery Management Page. 
If your item contains a bulb, remove it, determine bulb type and use OCRRA’s searchable database to find guidance for that specific type of bulb.









#2 - Reuse





1) Habitat for Humanity ReStore accepts the following large appliances as long as they are less than 10 years old, clean and in proven working condition: washers, dryers, refrigerators, gas and electric stoves, dishwashers, range hoods and microwaves. Visit their website or call (315) 475-9172 for more information.
2) Small household appliances in good working condition, such as can openers, toasters, blenders, coffee makers and electric knives, can be donated to the Salvation Army (315-445-0520) or Rescue Mission (315-453-7242).
3) Like new appliances that can fit in small spaces, including washers, dryers and refrigerators, can be donated to A Tiny Home for Good. Call (315) 220-0240 to confirm they can accept your item.
4) OCRRA’s Reuse link area lists free online exchange websites you can take advantage of easily.









#3 - Dispose





Large household appliances, such as microwaves, refrigerators and dishwashers, can be accepted at OCRRA’s Rock Cut Road Drop-Off Site.
Small household appliances, such as can openers, toasters and blenders can be disposed of with household trash. They do NOT belong in your recycling bin.
However, metal is recovered from trash at the Waste-to-Energy Facility in Jamesville, so it can be recycled. You can watch a video about the entire process on our waste-to-energy page.
