How Do I Get Rid Of Aerosol Cans?












There are two important considerations with aerosol can disposal. First, is it empty? Second, were the contents toxic?




#1 - Recycle





Only completely empty aerosol cans that never held household toxics can be put in your recycling bin.









#2 - Dispose





Aerosol cans that are empty, but previously held paint or toxics should be placed in the trash.
Aerosol cans that still contain household toxics or any type of leftover paint do not belong in the trash or recycling bin. You must make an appointment for OCRRA’s Household Hazardous Waste Drop-Off program. Reservations are required.
OCRRA pays a flat fee for the service, whether you bring one item or several materials for safe management. Please help us keep this program free to residents by planning ahead and gathering multiple household toxics to drop off in a single appointment.
