How Do I Get Rid Of Smoke Alarms?
















#1 - Recycle





Contact the manufacturer to find out if there is a return program.









#2 - Dispose





Smoke alarms can go in your regular trash. First, please check your device for a battery and manage the battery separately through the guidelines on our Battery Management Page. If the battery cannot be removed, Bruin Recycling will accept battery-embedded smoke alarms.
