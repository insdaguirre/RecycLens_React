Tires		






Turn in your worn-out tires as soon as you replace them.Nowadays, most tire stores and services centers will take your old tires off your hands when you buy new ones, making it an easy recycling habit for you. They know how to dispose of them properly. But some places do charge a fee. Some municipalities across the county accept used tires as well, for a small charge, but they may only accept certain sizes. Be sure to call ahead before you make a drop.Drop-Off LocationsFind out where you can dispose of old, used tires.Collection EventsYou can recycle your tires at no cost at one of our collection events. Some restrictions apply, see tire recycling guidelines here.
