Contain the sharps safely in your own home:Use a puncture-proof plastic container with a tight-fitting screw top. A plastic soda bottle or bleach bottle is good. Don't use glass because it can break. Coffee cans are not recommended because the plastic lids come off too easily.Label the container clearly. Write """"Contains Sharps"""" with a waterproof marker directly on the container or on masking tape on the container.Once you have used a syringe or lancet, immediately put it into your container. Screw on the top. Don't clip, bend or recap the needles because you could injure yourself.Keep the container away from children.When the container is full, screw on the cap tightly. Seal it with heavy-duty tape to be extra safe. There are different options for getting rid of the container of sharps. Choose the option that is most convenient and easy for you to use. Here are the best bets for safety, health, and protection of the environment:All hospitals and nursing homes in New York State are mandated by law to accept home-generated sharps as a free, community service through their sharps collection programs.
