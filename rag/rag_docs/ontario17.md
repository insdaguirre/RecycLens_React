LandfillThe Ontario County Landfill, located on State Routes 5 & 20 in the Town of Seneca, has been operated by the County and their various contractors since 1974. In 2003, the County signed a 25 year lease agreement with New England Waste Services of N.Y. (Casella) to operate and maintain the landfill. In addition to the landfill, Casella also operates a single stream/Zero Sort Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) on the same site.Currently, both the landfill and the MRF accept municipal solid waste and recyclables, respectively, from the County as well as from municipalities outside of Ontario County.The active geosynthetic lined landfill is designed, and permitted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), to receive an average of 2,999 tons of municipal solid waste per day.The MRF is equipped with mechanical and magnetic sorting equipment that separates different types of recyclables from each other. Once sorted these recyclables are baled and distributed to various markets for re-use.To learn more about the Zero Sort process utilized at the Materials Recovery Facility, watch our Informational Video below.Zero-Sort VideoWatch Casella's Zero-Sort® Recycling Facility Tour video.Landfill Alternative Analysis StudyAt its December 5, 2024 meeting, the Ontario County Board of Supervisors (BOS) approved two resolutions that will shape the future of solid waste management in Ontario County.The first resolution memorializes the commitment to close the Ontario County landfill by December 31, 2028, when the current operations and management lease agreement expires. The second resolution instructs the County’s Department of Sustainability and Solid Waste Management to identify viable strategies for achieving the county’s solid waste goals, emphasizing increased waste diversion and advancing sustainability.In order to make this decision the BOS commissioned a comprehensive analysis to provide the BOS with data and factual information aimed at helping them to make informed decisions about the landfill’s future. This detailed report included:Historic and current landfill operational data,Waste management processes and potential costs if the landfill is closed, andPotential alternative landfill site uses, whether the landfill is closed or remains open.As part of the outreach for the study and for decision making purposes, a website was developed, 3 public meetings were held, informational videos and podcasts were recorded, and opportunities for public comment were provided.
