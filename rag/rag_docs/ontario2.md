How to Unload Used Appliances, Large & SmallEver wondered what to do when your old fridge finally kicks the bucket? Appliances should not be placed in the trash or recycling. Appliances contain valuable metal and risky substances (like Freon) that can hurt the environment if they’re not handled the right way.If your appliance still works, donate it. Small appliances, such as microwaves and toasters, can often be donated to places like Goodwill or the Salvation Army. Working appliances can also be listed on a local buy nothing or marketplace group for free.Appliances that do not contain Freon/refrigerant:Drop off large appliances, that do not contain Freon or refrigerant, at your municipal transfer station or return them to the store where you bought them (usually when you purchase a new appliance). Some local haulers also collect appliances. View a list of drop-off locations and local haulers where you can properly dispose of your appliances. Be sure to call ahead for details and fees.Microwaves can be brought to an Ontario County sponsored Electronic Waste Event. Click here for details. Some transfer stations may accept microwaves in their scrap metal program. Call ahead for details.Appliances that contain Freon/refrigerant:Including refrigerators and freezers designed for home use, room air conditioners (including window air conditioners and packaged terminal air conditioners), packaged terminal heat pumps, dehumidifiers, under-the-counter ice makers, water heaters (refrigerant containing units only), and drinking water coolers that contain refrigerant/freon can be brought at no charge to an Ontario County sponsored Freon Containing Appliances Collection Event. Click here for details. Some municipal transfer stations also accept Freon containing devices check with your local transfer station for details. Freon containing devices can also be taken to ALPCO Recycling in Macedon. Some fees typically apply when properly disposing of a Freon containing device.RG&E Customer?RG&E customers are eligible for rebates for qualifying high-efficiency equipment. Visit their website for more details about participating in the program.Mercury Thermostat RecyclingYour thermostat may have a warning label that the device contains mercury. You can also remove the thermostat’s cover and check if you see a bulb or vial that contains a silver, metallic liquid. If present, this liquid is mercury. Keep mercury out of our waste stream by properly disposing of your mercury-containing thermostat. Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) wholesalers are required by law to accept mercury thermostats free of charge. Find collectors who will recycle your thermostat.Most thermostats are made without mercury now so they are less damaging to the environment and more energy efficient. Smart and Digital Thermostats are electronic waste. Click here for more information.
