Household Hazardous Waste		






Extreme Caution: Household Hazardous WasteHazardous Household Waste, or HHW, includes stuff we use every day around the house, like batteries, cleaners, paint, and solvents. Don’t throw them in the trash. Don’t pour them down the sink. Don’t flush them down the toilet. And—seriously—don’t dump them in the backyard. These are highly toxic chemicals that sewage treatment plants often can’t completely filter out. And even if it doesn’t make it to your faucet, improper disposal of contaminates can poison groundwater and harm plants and animals.Head to Our Collection DaysThe safest bet when it comes to any hazardous household waste is to bring it to one of the free collection events sponsored by Casella Waste Systems and Ontario County. HHW events are typically held every April and September. Please continue to check the Special Events page for dates, times and locations of events.Here’s a list of hazardous materials accepted at no charge at these events:
