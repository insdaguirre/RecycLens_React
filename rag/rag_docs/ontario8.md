Burned-out fluorescent bulbs have a dark side you can avoid.Whether you have the long, white tube-shaped bulbs on the newer style Compact Fluorescent Bulbs (CFLs), this type of bulb should never be thrown in the trash. They contain mercury, and if they break during disposal, that mercury is released into the environment, and it can build up over time. It’s a serious threat you want to prevent in our surrounding area. Take your burned-out bulbs to one of our household hazardous waste collection events, electronic waste collection events, or a retail drop-off location for recycling. You can find special collection event details here or check out the locations below that are equipped to handle these fragile products.For details about the mercury in CFLs, visit the EPA.Drop-Off LocationsEWaste +7318 Victor Mendon RoadVictor, NY 14564Phone: 888-563-1340Acceptable & Non-Acceptable Universal WasteLowes - Canandaigua (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs Only)4200 Recreation DriveCanandaigua, NY 14424Phone: 585-919-3300 Lowes - Geneva (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs Only)3030 Sessler DriveGeneva, NY 14456Phone: 315-781-9000AlternativesNeed an alternative or have a lot of bulbs to unload?Find out more from these mail-in services:Waste ManagementEasyPak
