What Do You Do With Scrap Metal?Old lawnmower blades. Car bumpers. Pipes. Bed frames. You’d be surprised at how much junk metal county residents can generate in a year. We all have some spare parts around the house we’re looking to unload. And, while these items can't be put in your household recycling bin, some towns have a collection program. And if yours doesn’t, you can take your junk metal parts to a local scrap yard. You might even make a few bucks, depending on the type of metal you’re getting rid of.Find out where you can drop off metal.Propane TanksHave an old or unwanted propane tank and are looking to dispose of it?
