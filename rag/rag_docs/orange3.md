Refrigerant Recycling		






Recycling refrigerants from appliances is one of the most important things to recycle.  Not only can the refrigerant be recycled to be used again, but the refrigerant is also safely removed to prevent the potentially detrimental effect its gases have on the environment.  See the below brochure for more information on your options for recycling refrigerant containing appliances in Orange County.Orange County Refrigerant Brochure
