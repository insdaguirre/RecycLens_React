Trash Disposal
        



 



Residents may use transfer stations for trash disposal. The options available for residents are as follows:

Residential Stickers:  2025 Residential Stickers are on sale as of  December 1st for $200.00 at all Transfer Stations!
Prepaid  tall kitchen bags: $20 for ten 13-gallon bags
Weigh and Pay: $155 ton (.0775) per pound, $10 minimum charge). Hannibal Transfer Station does not have drive on scales. There is a floor scale for small loads.
2025 Holiday
Tires - Tires are not covered on the sticker. Tires are charged at $300 ton, $10 minimum. Bristol Hill, Hastings, and Pulaski  Transfer Stations accept tires during normal operating hours. Farm tractor or loader tires must be quartered.

You may also contact a private hauler for curb side pickup, or check with your local municipality (city, town, village) to see if they provide municipal pickup.Keep in mind that haulers do not pick up furniture, appliances, used motor oil, electronics, household batteries, or household hazardous waste. These items (except household hazardous waste) may be delivered to transfer stations during regular transfer station hours.  If bringing boats to the Transfer Stations they must be cut up into 3 ft. pieces.  If boats are whole they must be brought to Bristol Hill and put on the landfill. The engine, gas, oil, and septic waste must be removed before disposal.  All hot tubs must be cut into quarters or they will not be accepted.Household hazardous waste is only accepted May through September at Bristol Hill. All loads of solid waste entering facilities must be covered.Things that are NOT accepted as Waste in Landfill

Recyclables - Recyclables are NOT waste and should be recycled at the transfer station.  Placing recyclables into the waste stream costs unnecessary money and potentially causes damages to the Energy Recovery Facility when they are processed.
Metal - Metal is not allowed in the landfill and can cause the County to be fined.  Metal also causes damages to the Energy Recovery Facility when being processed.
Hazardous Waste - Hazardous Waste must be brought to our Household Hazardous Waste operation during operating hours.  Hazardous Waste is not allowed into the Oswego County Landfill and can cause the County to be fined.
Tires - Tires are not allowed in the landfill and can cause the County to be fined.  Tires are handled separately at participating transfer stations. Farm tractor or loader tires must be quartered.
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are handled separately at the transfer stations so that the chemicals may be removed before processing.  Examples of CFCs are refrigerators, air conditioners and dehumidifiers. A $20 CFC must be purchased to dispose.

When in doubt, call and ask if something is accepted!Payment OptionsCash or check: Make checks payable to Oswego County Solid Waste, $20 return check feeCredit card: From $5.00 - $42.00 there will be a $1.00 fee. From $43.00 and up there will be a 2.35% fee.For Information about Business/Hauler Permits click here.
