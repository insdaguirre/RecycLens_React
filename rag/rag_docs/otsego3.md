Before Clean-up, vent the room.              • Open a window and leave the room for 15 minutes or more.               • Shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning system, if you have one. Clean-Up Steps for Hard Surfaces              • Carefully scoop up glass fragments and powder using stiff paper or cardboard and place them in a              glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar) or in a sealed plastic bag.              • Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.              • Wipe the area clean with damp paper towels or disposable wet wipes and place them in the glass jar              or plastic bag.              • Do not use a vacuum or broom to clean up the broken bulb on hard surfaces.Clean-up Steps for Carpeting or Rug              • Carefully pick up glass fragments and place them in a glass jar with metal lid (such as a canning jar)              or in a sealed plastic bag.              • Use sticky tape, such as duct tape, to pick up any remaining small glass fragments and powder.              • If vacuuming is needed after all visible materials are removed, vacuum the area where the bulb was              broken.              • Remove the vacuum bag (or empty and wipe the canister), and put the bag or vacuum debris in a              sealed plastic bag.
Disposal of Clean-up Materials              • Immediately place all clean-up materials outside the building in a trash container or outdoor              protected area for the next normal trash.              • Wash your hands after disposing of the jars or plastic bags containing clean-up materials.              • Check with your local or state government about disposal requirements in your specific area. Some              states prohibit such trash disposal and require that broken and unbroken lamps be taken to a local              recycling center. Future Cleaning of Carpet or Rug: Vent the Room During and After Vacuuming              • For at least the next few times you vacuum, shut off the central forced-air heating/air conditioning              system and open a window prior to vacuuming.              • Keep the central heating/air conditioning system shut off and the window open for at least 15              minutes after vacuuming is completed.

Clearly label the bottle “Needles.” You can then dispose of needles and syringes with the regular trash; however, do not put the container in a bag with other garbage. Leave the bottle on the curb next to your regular trash so your hauler can handle it (it is recommended that you call your hauler to inquire if there are any other, specific requirements for preparing needles and syringes). You can use this online tool to find out locations to drop off needles and syringes: https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/consumers/prevention/needles_syringes/sharps/Needles/syringes can also be dropped off at the outpatient lab at FoxCare and at the outpatient pharmacy at Bassett Medical Center. Needles and syringes are NOT accepted at Otsego County’s HHWD. All hospitals and nursing homes in New York State are mandated by law to accept home-generated sharps as a free community service through their sharps collection programs. In addition, pharmacies, health clinics, community-based organizations, mobile van programs, public transportation facilities, housing projects, police stations, waste transfer stations and other venues have become settings for safe sharps and offer syringe collection drop boxes (or “kiosks”) to help facilitate the safe collection of used sharps.
