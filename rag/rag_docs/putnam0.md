        Have a safe and successful litter cleanup:    


Safety Checklist for Litter Clean-up Event


Immediately call 911 when an emergency happens.
Never walk on guide rails.
NO HORSEPLAY
Stay off the underside of overhead bridges.
Do not lean over bridge railings.
Always face on-coming traffic.
Do not to park vehicles on roadways or shoulders.
All must always wear orange shirts or vests.
Wear long pants, sturdy shoes/boots, and appropriate gloves.
Never pick up needles, syringes, jagged glass, animal carcasses or heavy objects. Volunteers are not to pick up anything that could be hazardous.
All 12-to-17-year-old volunteers must be supervised; there must be at least one adult supervisor for every six 12-to-17-year-olds.
There will be no activity of any kind by volunteers on the roadway surface. Stay to the left of the white pavement stripe.
Do not engage in horseplay or other such activity that might jeopardize the volunteers’ safety or distract motorists.
Volunteers should have a first aid kit with them, and transportation should always be available.At least one volunteer at each cleanup should know CPR in case there is an emergency.Volunteers should avoid over exertion and make arrangements to provide drinking water in hot weather.




Tips for a Successful Litter Clean-up Event


The day before the cleanup, take 2 backpacks and individually stuff as many orange bags as you can into each backpack (individually vs. all together is very important). The backpacks will allow the volunteers to just pull out additional bags as they walk along.NOTE: having one hand for the litter grabber and the other for the bag does not allow volunteers to carry the additional bags…the 40″ X 48″ bags are thick and are just too big to put over one’s belt. There will generally be 18 -24 bags used per mile.
Bring a fully charged cell phone, gloves, and wet wipes. Hiking shoes will give more support than sneakers.

To keep the volunteers from slowing each other down…

Everyone meet at a place approximately in the middle of your section.
Split the group in half.
Each group to walk (WALKING FACING TRAFFIC) along your section heading in opposite directions.
When the 2 groups get to the respective ends your section (where the Adopt-a-Highway signs are), they are then to carefully cross the road and walk back to the place where they parted with the other group WALKING FACING TRAFFIC.
Splitting the groups means that each will only have to walk 1/2 the distance and they will not bunch up.

Fill the bags only 2/3 please, as the crews have to lift them over their heads into the back of a truck. As the bags get 2/3 filled, tie the tops and leave them alongside the road. If you find a large object, just put that on top of the orange bag.
