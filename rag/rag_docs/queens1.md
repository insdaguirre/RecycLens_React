Trash
We offer FREE weekly curbside collection service, making it easy for you to get rid of your trash and keep our city clean.
New Yorkers throw out over 10,000 tons of garbage a day. We are committed to removing the mountains of black bags on New York City streets, reclaiming public space, and improving the quality of life for all New Yorkers.
Requesting Collection Service
You can request DSNY trash and recycling collection for an address that has never had service or had previously been vacant.
Learn more and submit a request.
Setting Out Trash
As of November 12, 2024, single- and two-family homes, and buildings with up to 9 apartments are required to use bins with secure lids for trash set out.
Residential Buildings with 1-9 Units

Place trash out after 6:00 PM in a bin of 55 gallons or less with a secure lid

Residential Buildings with 10+ Units

Place trash out after 6:00 PM in a bin of 55 gallons or less with a secure lid, or
Place trash out after 8:00 PM, if putting bags directly on the curb

To ensure collection, all waste must be set out by midnight.
Learn more about the new bin requirements for New Yorkers receiving curbside collection.
Purchase your official NYC Bins at www.bins.nyc or by calling 1-855-NYC-BINS.
Bin Storage
Bins should be stored inside or in alleyways, courtyards, or other outdoor areas away from public sidewalks. If space is not available, you may store bins within three feet of your building. Containers must be kept neat and allow for pedestrian travel. Enclosures on the sidewalk are subject to NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.

Download and print decals and signage for your trash bins and storage areas.
Missed Collection
You can report that your trash, recycling, or compost was not picked up starting at 8:00 AM the day after your collection day.
To report missed collection, call 311 or submit a complaint online.
Large Items
A large item (also known as bulk) is something that is too large to fit into a bin or bag. NYC residents can get free curbside removal of large items.
Learn more about disposing large items.
