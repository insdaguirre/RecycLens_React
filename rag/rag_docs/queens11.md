Furniture, Mattresses, and Rugs
Many furniture items are too large to fit in a bin or bag. NYC residents can get free curbside removal of these items.
Furniture
For large furniture items – like bed frames, bookcases, couches and sofas, desks, dressers, and tables and chairs – follow rules for large (bulk) items:
Set out:

Items that are mostly metal or plastic with recycling
All other items with trash

Large items that aren't recyclable – including wood and wood composites (fiberboard, particle board) – should be set out on your trash-only day, NOT your recycling day.
Take apart, if possible, before setting out for collection. Bundle smaller pieces together and tape or tie with twine.
NOTE: Glass furniture and mirrors CANNOT be recycled. Set these out with trash. Tape up large glass items and double-bag broken glass to avoid injury when being handled.
Exercise Equipment
Though some exercise equipment is electronic, most is not considered e-waste and should be disposed of by following regular rules for trash and recycling and large items.
For large equipment – like elliptical machines, stationary bikes, treadmills, and other home gym items – take apart, if possible, before setting out for collection. Batteries must be removed and disposed of properly.
Mattresses and Box Springs
Set out mattresses and box springs on your trash-only day, NOT your recycling day.
Bedding items like mattresses and box springs MUST be sealed in plastic bags (to prevent the spread of bed bugs).

If you do not dispose of a mattress or box spring correctly, you may be fined up to $300.

Rugs and Carpets
Roll up and securely tie rugs and carpeting with twine. Set out with trash.
