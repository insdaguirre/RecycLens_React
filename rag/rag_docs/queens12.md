Gas Cylinders and Fire Extinguishers
Gas cylinders can explode inside our collection trucks, causing serious injury and damage.
DO NOT dispose of pressurized gas cylinders with trash or recycling.
These include:

ANY compressed gas fuel tanks or canisters (propane, butane, acetylene, MAPP gas)
Oxygen tanks
Helium (balloon) tanks
Carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinders
Fire extinguishers

Disposal
Propane and other fuel gasses are highly flammable and should be handled with extreme caution.
To get rid of most gas cylinders, you can:

Exchange them when buying a new one
Return them to a store or dealer where they are sold
Take them to a scrap metal dealer
Bring them to a SAFE Disposal Event

Fire Extinguishers
Do not place in trash or recycling. Contact a FDNY-certified fire extinguisher retailer or bring to a SAFE Disposal Event.
Most fire extinguishers are refillable by FDNY-certified fire extinguisher retailers.
