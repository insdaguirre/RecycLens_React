Large Items
Something is considered a large item (or bulk item) if it is too large to fit inside a bin or bag.
NYC residents can get free curbside removal of large items. You can set out up to 6 items at the curb per collection day. Pick-up appointments are no longer offered and cannot be scheduled.
For curbside collection, set out:

Metal and rigid plastic items with recycling
All other non-recyclable items with trash

NOTE: Large items that aren't recyclable should be set out on your trash-only day, NOT your recycling day.
Find your collection schedule
Special Disposal Rules
Some large items require special disposal. If you do not follow the requirements when disposing of these items, we may refuse to collect them and you may be fined.

A/Cs, dehumidifier, freezer, and refrigerators
Construction debris
Electronics and e-waste
Mattresses and box springs
Rugs and carpets
Tires
