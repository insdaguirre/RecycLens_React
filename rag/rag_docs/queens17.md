Medical Waste
Some materials used to manage health and medical conditions can be dangerous or considered biohazards and require special disposal.
If you do not dispose of medical waste properly, you may be a fined.
Regulated Medical Waste
NYC and New York State laws have strict requirements on the storage, transport, and disposal of certain biological or healthcare-related materials, including:

Sharps (scalpel blades, syringes, lancets and needles)
Human pathological waste (body parts and body fluids)
Carcasses, body parts, or bedding of contaminated or infectious animals (including with rabies)
Materials contaminated with blood or other infectious waste (bandages, disposable sheets, medical gloves, tubing, and intravenous (IV) tubes/needles)

It is illegal to dispose of these materials with household trash or recycling. Contact a medical professional or a private hazardous waste company.
Sharps
Place syringes, needles, scalpels, lancets, and other sharp objects in a "sharps" container or other leak-proof, puncture-resistant container, such as a laundry detergent bottle.
Carefully seal the container and label "HOME SHARPS" and place in trash. DO NOT place in recycling or flush down a toilet.
Used sharps can also be taken to:

Any hospital or nursing home in New York State (call first for hours and locations)
SAFE Disposal Events
Pharmaceutical/sharps drop-off locations

Contact the NY State Department of Health at 800-522-5006 if a hospital or nursing home refuses to accept your sharps.
Medication
Never flush medication down the drain or in the toilet.
Medication can be taken to:

SAFE Disposal Events
Pharmaceutical/sharps drop-off locations
Pharmacies that have take-back programs
Local collection events

You can also place medication in a container with undesirable material, such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter, seal the container, and place the container in the trash.
Radiation Therapy
People receiving radiation therapy carry radioactive material in their biological system. This radioactive material can be excreted into tissues, diapers, or sanitary napkins.
Do not dispose of these contaminated items in the trash or toilet.

Separate the contaminated items from other trash and place in a closed bin.
Keep the bin in a location away from people, so that the radiation can naturally dissipate prior to disposal.

Medical Equipment and Accessories
Mostly metal or rigid plastic: set out with recycling on the night before your recycling collection day.
Clean, uncontaminated soft plastic, and film plastic: set out with trash the night before your trash collection day.
Professional Medical and Healthcare Waste
Institutions like hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centers, residential health care facilities, and clinical laboratories must meet following state and local requirements when disposing of certain waste.
