You can recycle mixed paper together in a labeled bin with a secure lid or a clear plastic bag. Flatten and bundle corrugated cardboard (tie with twine) and set out next to bins or bags. DO NOT use cardboard boxes as bins.

Cardboard
You can recycle corrugated cardboard, shipping, shoe, and gift boxes, file folders, paper cups (empty and dry), and lightly-soiled pizza boxes.
NOTE: DO NOT recycle beverage and liquid food cartons (like milk cartons and juice boxes) with paper. They should be recycled with your metal, glass, and plastic.
