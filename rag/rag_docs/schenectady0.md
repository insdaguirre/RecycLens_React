Single Stream Recycling
SINGLE STREAM RECYCLING
The City of Schenectady introduced Single Stream Recycling in September 2016. Single Stream Recycling allows you to co-mingle paper, plastic, tin and glass. The new Single Stream Recycling Stickers will be available at City Hall, Room 9. 

Any containers still bearing a Yellow or Blue recycling sticker will still be picked up until the resident obtains the new Single Stream Recycling sticker. 

TO CITY RESIDENTS FROM GARY R. MCCARTHY, MAYOR: 
"The City of Schenectady Waste Collection Departments' goal is to increase public awareness on the importance of recycling. Increased recycling will have a positive effect on our environment, reduce the solid waste sent to landfill and provide financial gains for our community. One ton of recycling removed from the waste stream is a disposal cost savings of $70.67. If recycling were to increase by 1,000 tons per year, it would be a disposal cost avoidance of $70,670..."
