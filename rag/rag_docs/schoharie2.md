🔥FIRE EXTINGUISHERS: The Transfer Station accepts empty fire extinguishers as metal waste. Full extinguishers can be recycled at Fyr Fyter in Oneonta (607-433-2800). 
📱ELECTRONICS can be recycled year-round free of charge at the Schoharie County Transfer Station.Please visit How Do I Dispose of ___? for more recycling information!
