          e-Waste Recycling
        




Electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials, including metals, plastics, and glass, all of which require energy to mine and manufacture.
Recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials.
The best way to be sure that these hazardous wastes do not end up in landfills and their components recovered for another use is to recycle them.
