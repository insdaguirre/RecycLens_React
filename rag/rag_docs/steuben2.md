What's New?As of January 1, 2015 electronics were no longer acceptable for disposal at landfills in New York State (NYS). This is part of a phased ban of electronics that began in 2011, per the NYS Electronic Equipment Recycling and Reuse Act (PDF).The County offers an electronics recycling program at all of our solid waste facilities. You will still be able to get rid of your unwanted electronics.Items AcceptedElectronics such as PCs, televisions, printers, DVD players, cellphones, and video game systems. All "Covered Electronic Equipment" per the NYSDEC guideline is accepted. (Learn about EWaste.) Limit 5 pieces per vehicle. If you have more, please call the landfill to make special arrangements.Please note: Beginning December 1st, 2022, all electronics are free of charge.No exchange or removal of items is permitted.Not accepted: Items such as microwaves, typewriters, toasters, and large copiers are not accepted as part of this program.When & Where to Bring ItBring your eligible electronics waste to any of our solid waste facilities during normal business hours.Eligibility to ParticipateOnly Steuben County residents can participate.
