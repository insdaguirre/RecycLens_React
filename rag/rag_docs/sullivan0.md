The Department of Solid Waste & Recycling manages Sullivan County's solid waste disposal program, including the County transfer station and materials recovery facility in Monticello, along with five recycling/convenience stations throughout the County.  Sullivan County does not pick up garbage from residents or businesses; commercial haulers can be found in your local telephone directory.
