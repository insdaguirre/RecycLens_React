                                Reuse/Repurpose
                            






 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is reuse/repurpose?
Reuse is simply defined as items we can use the same thing many times.  Repurpose is creating or using something for a purpose other than its original intended use.  Repurposing an item can be done by modifying it to fit a new use, or by using the item as is in a new way.
Why is reuse/repurpose important?
Reuse helps to conserve resources, prevent pollution and save money.

How can you incorporate more REUSE in your life?

Limit your use of single-use items like plastic bags, plastic water bottles, paper towels and plates, etc.

Use reusable containers such as mason jars, cloth bags, and reusable bottles.

Keeping something perfectly good going into the trash 

Whether it is hosting or shopping at a garage sale, pulling over for that item with a “free” sign, bringing your no-longer-wanted clothes to a local charity or drop-box, or listing an item on craigslist or Facebook marketplace, there are many ways to reuse durable goods. By keeping the item in play, you just saved the fossil fuels, water, virgin materials, and energy that it took for that product to come to be.
You can be proud of the resource conservation you are involved in. Setting this example is an important part of normalizing reuse and welcoming it as we make strides towards a more circular economy.

Fix it!  Look to repair or fix items from clothing to appliances. 

If you need help, there are organizations that will help you fix items.  One such organization is the Ithaca Fixers Collective Fixers Collective | Finger Lakes ReUse (ithacareuse.org/fixers/)

                                Is My Garbage Hauler Throwing the Recycling Out with the Trash?
                            





No! They are probably using a split body garbage truck.
 
What is a split body garbage truck?
 
Split body trucks are designed so that regular garbage can be collected in one side, while all recyclables are stored in the other side. Many haulers operating in Tioga County are using split body trucks.

Borrow-A-Bin Program
Special Event Recycling Program
 
Looking for a way to recycle at your next community event? Consider the Borrow-A-Bin program.
The Borrow-A-Bin program is a free service that aims to maximize waste diversion at events in Tioga County by loaning up to 40 beverage recycling bins to local events, large or small.
 How to Borrow-A-Bin:

Fill out the Borrow-A-Bin form.  Bins will be available on a first come, first serve basis. Please allow time to process your request.
Transportation of bins to and from the event is the responsibility of the event’s recycling coordinator or the bin borrower.
Up to 2 bags per bin offered, totaling up to 20 bags per sign-out. Most bins require a 50-gallon trash bag.
Assembly and breakdown (Instructions link) of the bins are the responsibility of the event’s recycling coordinator or bin borrower. 

Bins must be returned clean and in good condition within two (2) business days following your event.


 Planning an Event with Recycling:
Helpful Tips:

Determine a committee or individual to oversee implementation of the program.
Use a timeline to help stay on task during planning.
Involve organizers, volunteers, haulers and vendors.
Plan to have trash and recycling emptied regularly.
During and after the event monitor & evaluate the recycling program.

What to recycle?
You should examine your waste stream to determine what to target. Generally, at festivals, fairs and events food and plastics are a large quantity of the waste. The following items should be targeted for recycling:
Aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles, tin and cardboard.
Examine what food & beverages are being vended. Most often bottles and cans will be one of the primary recyclables collected.
Typically, vendors (and exhibitors) produce most of the corrugated cardboard waste at special events. Therefore, cardboard collection points need not be located at public recycling stations, but can be staged behind the scenes, near dumpsters. If sufficient staff is available, circulate around vendor areas to collect cardboard as it is generated. The added convenience may encourage vendors, who were not otherwise inclined, to recycle.
Vendors And Staff
Work closely with all staff and event vendors to ensure proper recycling is being conducted and promoted. Work to encourage waste reduction.
Vendors should be clear on how and when recyclables will be collected.
Staff should be prepared to empty recycling containers on a routine basis, so none overflow.
Staff should be instructed where to properly place recyclables for pickup.
Be sure to continue good recycling practices during the breakdown of the event.
Contracting With a Hauler
In Tioga County your garbage hauler can also provide recycling services for a small fee.
Contact a local hauler to set up hauling of recyclables to a designated recycling facility.
Work with hauler to get an appropriately sized container.
Review preparation guidelines to ensure materials are properly prepared for collection by the hauler or recycler. For example, if recyclables can remain bagged.
Suggested Educational, Signage, & Promotion Ideas:

Pre- and post-event press releases featuring the recycling program.
Use brightly colored signage to ensure recycling containers stand out from the garbage cans.
Reminders to recycle during the event over a P.A. system.
Special shirts for the cleaning crew, advertising recycling.
Information about the recycling program in publications, programs, ads, etc.…

Tioga County Sheriff’s Office -Medication Drop Box is located in the main lobby of the Tioga County Sheriff’s Office at 103 Corporate Drive, Owego, NY. The drop box is available Monday through Friday between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Needles, lancets, other “sharps” and liquids are not accepted.
Village of Owego Police Department -Prescription Drop Box is located in the Village of Owego Police Department at 90 Temple St, Owego, NY, (607) 687-2233. The drop box is available Monday through Friday between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Needles, lancets, other “sharps” and liquids are not accepted.
Village of Waverly Police Department -Medication Drop Box is located at the Village of Waverly Police Department located at 32 Ithaca Street, Waverly, NY. The drop box is available Monday through Friday between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM.  Needles/Sharps are not accepted.
 
Household Sharps Disposal Guidelines:
Safe disposal of sharps (needles, syringes, lancets) prevents sharps from being re-used or shared, which can spread disease.
Safe disposal protects children, pets and workers, who handle trash & recyclables, from injury or illness.
Safe disposal protects the environment.
Follow the below guidelines when storing sharps until they can safely be disposed of.
DO -

Place used Sharps in a sharps container. Containers can be purchased at the local drug store. If you do not have a sharps container use a plastic bottle that cannot be broken or punctured, such as a detergent bottle. Screw cap on & tape cap. Write “SHARPS” on the container. Bring to a designated drop-off location that accepts sharps.
Place sharps in container directly after use. Keep container closed and away from children and pets. Store in a secure location.
When traveling bring container with you.

 DON'T -

Don’t put sharps containers in the trash.* 
Don’t clip, bend or put the cap back on used sharps
Don’t put loose used sharps or used sharps container in with the recyclables
Don’t put used sharps in soda cans, milk cartons, glass bottles or containers that can be broken or punctured. Coffee cans are not safe because plastic lids come off easily, leak and can be punctured.

*Used sharps containers can be placed in the trash only if access to a drop-off is not available

                                Mercury In Your Home
                            





Mercury is a shiny, silvery liquid metal that can cause serious health problems -
Liquid mercury vaporizes (evaporates) at room temperature causing elevated levels of mercury in indoor air. Mercury vapor is not irritating and has no odor, so people do not know when they are breathing it. Even the small amount of mercury from a broken thermometer can cause harm, especially to children, unless it is properly cleaned up and removed.
Mercury health effects -

Breathing small amounts of mercury vapor can harm the nervous system of unborn babies, nursing infants, and children.
Breathing larger amounts of mercury vapor can cause irritability, tremors, or memory loss; shortness of breath; respiratory & eye irritation; chest pain; high blood pressure; kidney damage.

Know where mercury may be found in your home -
Mercury may be found in thermometers, thermostats, blood pressure units, barometers and gas pressure regulators. Exposure to mercury can occur when people handle or play with the liquid metal, or when a measuring device breaks and mercury beads scatter onto floors or other surfaces. Spilled mercury is very hard to clean up, especially if it rolls into cracks and crevices, or if it is on fabric, upholstery or other porous material.
If you have old mercury thermometers or thermostats hanging around and you’re not sure what to do with them, you have several options.
1. Mercury Thermometers and Thermostats may be properly disposed at through the Tioga County Hazardous Waste Program.
Mismanaged mercury can be toxic and under certain circumstances can have highly detrimental effects on the nervous system. Removing mercury thermometers from the trash or the sanitary sewers is of considerable benefit to the environment.
2. Click on the following website for a list of other locations that accept THERMOSTATS in the community.

What you should do immediately after a mercury spill -
Avoid contact with the spilled mercury until you decide who will be cleaning it up - you or a professional. In general, you can clean up a small mercury spill yourself, such as from a fever thermometer or thermostat. This fact sheet provides a step-by-step guide on pages 3-4 on how to do the cleanup.
The New York State Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation recommend that a trained professional, such as a hazardous waste contractor, do the cleanup whenever the amount of mercury spilled is greater than what is typically found in a fever thermometer or thermostat. In other words, if the amount of mercury spilled exceeds 3 grams or about the size of a green pea, a trained professional should do the cleanup.
Avoid spreading spilled mercury!

Never use a vacuum cleaner, mop or broom to clean up a mercury spill.
Avoid walking through the spill area.
Take children and pets to another room. Leave any clothing or footwear that came into contact with the spilled mercury in the affected room. If possible, close the doors of the room with the spilled mercury to keep vapors from spreading.

If the amount of mercury is more than what is in a thermometer - consider the following:

Stay out of the room until you begin the cleanup. If you cannot clean the area immediately, cover the spill and surrounding area with plastic. You can use one or more trash bags, overlapping side by side, to cover the beads until you can clean the spill.
Lower the room temperature, if possible, to reduce evaporation of mercury.
Shut down or close off vents that could spread mercury vapors to other areas.
Open exterior windows to ventilate any mercury vapors to the outdoors. If possible, place a fan in a window to blow the vapors out but avoid breezes that might blow the mercury vapor back indoors or into other nearby residences. You can run a bathroom exhaust fan or a cooking stove hood but only if it vents outdoors and only if it is located in the same room as the mercury spill.

Decide who will do the cleanup - you or a professional?
If the spill is... more than the amount in a mercury fever thermometer or thermostat, or if it is widely scattered, or if the spill is on carpeting which cannot be thrown out, or on upholstered furniture, or other porous items that cannot be bagged... you should call a trained professional. Check your telephone Yellow Pages under "Environmental engineers" or “Engineering services".
If in doubt... contact your local health department or others listed at the end of this fact sheet for more information.
Plan ahead if you have mercury-containing items in your home - get a Mercury Spill Kit
Mercury spill clean-up kits are available for purchase from laboratory equipment suppliers (some are listed in the box to the right). Carefully follow all the directions provided in the kit.
These mercury spill kits generally contain powders and suction devices. Additionally, it is recommended that you collect the items listed below and keep them with the kit.
List of what can be used to clean up a mercury spill:

latex or vinyl gloves
flashlight
zipper-type plastic bags (several)
plastic trash bags (at least two)
wide tape (masking, duct or clear)
paper towels
eyedropper
two index cards or pieces of stiff cardboard
sulfur powder (see below for details)
water to moisten paper towels

Sulfur powder (also called flowers of sulfur) can be purchased from agriculture supply stores, garden centers, and some pharmacies. For questions about the type of sulfur powder used during mercury spill cleanup, please contact the New York State Department of Health at 518-402-7810 or 800-458-1158.

WARNING

NEVER use a vacuum cleaner, mop or broom to clean up a mercury spill. Heat from the vacuum cleaner's motor will increase the amount of mercury vapor in the air. Mops and brooms will spread the mercury, making proper clean up more difficult. The vacuum cleaner, mop or broom will become contaminated with mercury.
NEVER use a washer or dryer to clean clothing that became contaminated with liquid mercury. The washer and dryer can become contaminated with mercury. If these items are contaminated with mercury, they are very difficult to clean and may have to be disposed as hazardous waste.

Practical Information about mercury
A mercury spill usually forms several pools and many beads of mercury. Mercury does not stick to most materials other than some metals. Mercury beads roll very easily, often scattering long distances from the original location of the spill and getting into cracks and crevices where it can be very difficult to remove them. Cleaning up a mercury spill requires patience and attention to detail to recover the mercury and to limit your exposure to toxic mercury vapors.
Before you start to do a mercury spill cleanup!
At this point, you should have read the previous sections in this fact sheet that describe a small mercury spill, what you should do immediately after a mercury spill and what you need to know if you decide to do the spill cleanup yourself. The following section is a general step–by–step guide on how to clean up a small mercury spill. You should complete each of the following steps to recover the spilled mercury and remove the contamination. Any mercury not removed will continue to be a source of potentially harmful mercury vapors.
