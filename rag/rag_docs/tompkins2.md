Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) – Residential

What’s Accepted

Liquid animal fats

How to Prepare Material
FOG stands for fats, oils, and grease. To dispose of it properly, collect cooled FOG at home using a funnel and an empty milk jug or similar reusable container, then pour it into the designated FOG collector. It’s important that FOG is in liquid form—solidified fats can clog our collection screens and disrupt the system. For example, coconut oil may solidify at room temperature, making it difficult to process. Always ensure your FOG is cooled but still liquid before bringing it in.
