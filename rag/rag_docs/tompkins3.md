How to Recycle Food Scraps



Collect your food scraps in your kitchen caddy.
Empty your kitchen caddy into a transportation container with a secure lid.
Bring your transportation container to one of our Drop Spot locations to dispose of your food scraps.

Note: Your first caddy is available free of charge from the Department or Recycling and Materials Management office or at any Drop Spot. Each additional caddy is $5. Transportation containers are available for sale at the Recycling and Materials Management office for $13. Residents are welcome to use alternative transportation containers.

Keeping Your Bin Clean
Participants may choose to use compostable liners with their food scraps. The program accepts BPI-certified compostable liners, which are available in the trash bag aisle of several local and big box stores and online. However, many participants choose to save money and reduce consumption by using other materials like newspaper and paper towels, or simply going liner-less. Here are some easy-to-implement tips to keep your food scraps bin clean and odor-free:

Line your bin with newspaper or paper towel. A drop of dish soap on bottom before paper makes clean-up easier. You can compost the paper with your food scraps.
Store your food scraps in freezer until drop spot day.
Sprinkle baking soda on top of food scraps.
Drop off your scraps more frequently.




Drop Off Procedure



Stop and see the Drop Spot attendant, and follow instructions to the blue tote.
Gently place your food scraps in the tote. Be sure to close the lid.
Users may bring up to 10-gallons (two 5-gallon buckets) per day.
Alternate Container Ideas:

Reuse plastic coffee containers or other containers that are about 2.5-gallons in size for your kitchen caddy.
Reuse a clean kitty litter, food service, or home improvement bucket as your transportation container.
Using a kitchen caddy or transport container is not required.

Liquid Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG)

Fats, oils, and grease are a valuable resource that can be turned into biodiesel and other products. They don’t belong in your drain where they can cause clogs and other problems that are expensive to fix. Residents of Tompkins County can collect the liquid fats, oils, and grease from their cooking and then deposit it at the FOG station at the Recycling and Solid Waste Center.
Procedures for collecting liquid FOG:

Allow the liquid FOG to cool.
Using a funnel, pour liquid FOG into a reusable container such as an empty milk jug.
When convenient, deposit FOG at the RSWC.




Join the Compost Club!

Tompkins County Recycling and Materials Management (TCRMM) is creating new Compost Club sites for residents who want to drop off their food scraps for composting on their own schedule. Compost Clubs are now set up at Greater Ithaca Activities Center, Enfield Town Clerk and two multifamily apartment complexes.
Here’s how it works:

Fill out this Food Scrap Recycling Compost Club Registration Form to register as a participant.
Keep an eye out for emails from staff. Once admitted, you’ll receive a combination code to access your Community Drop Off point plus information about how to participate.
Collect food scraps at home and drop off at your convenience.

New participants will be added on a rolling basis as capacity allows. Food scraps collected are brought to the Recycling and Solid Waste Center and processed by Cayuga Compost.
Questions? Call 607-273-6632 or contact us.
