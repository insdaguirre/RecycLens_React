Frequently Asked Questions


What do I need to dispose of trash at the Recycling and Solid Waste Center?

A valid solid waste permit is required to bring in materials with an associated fee, such as trash or tires. Punch cards, coupons, or scale weight are used to pay for trash disposal. To obtain a permit you will need your vehicle license plate number and valid ID proving Tompkins County residency or your current vehicle registration. If your ID or vehicle registration lists an address outside of the County, then proof of Tompkins County residency (electric bill, etc.) is also required.



What is a Solid Waste Permit used for?

A solid waste permit gives users access to drop off trash, yard waste, tires, Freon units, and other materials that have an associated fee. A valid permit also allows users to sign up for Household Hazardous Waste events.



Do I need a permit to drop off recycling?

No. Solid waste permits are required to drop off materials that have an associated fee and to participate in Household Hazardous Waste events. They are not required to drop off single stream recycling, food scraps, and other materials without associated fees.



How do I transfer my permit to a new or different vehicle?

Users can get a replacement for their valid permit free of charge. Visit the shop online page and select “Solid Waste Permit Replacement, or visit the Recycling and Materials Management office. The registration of the vehicle receiving the new permit is required.



How do I get a permit for a borrowed or rented vehicle?

Users with a valid solid waste permit can get a one day pass free of charge to use with a borrowed or rented vehicle.



Should I pay for my trash with a punch card, coupon, or by weight?

Punch cards are the best option for disposing of a small amount of trash in bags or cans. Punch cards are $15 and include 5 punches. Each punch allows for the disposal of one 35 pound bag or can of trash.
Disposal coupons are $15 for one vehicle load contained within a sedan, SUV, or minivan. This is a great option for disposing of a large amount of trash contained inside the vehicle. Pickup trucks, commercial vans, and other larger vehicles may not use the disposal coupon.
Paying by weight is a good option for bulky items such as mattresses and couches, or truck and trailer loads. The tiered rates and per ton fee for trash disposal are listed above.
