Trash Tags
All trash set out for collection in Tompkins County must have a trash tag affixed to the bag or can. One tag is required for each weight denomination listed on the tag. Trash not collected may be left with a note explaining why it was not collected. In the City of Ithaca, residents may face a fine if uncollected waste is not removed. Read the local trash tag law.
To receive trash collection services, Tompkins County residents and businesses must arrange for pickup with a Tompkins County licensed hauler.
The City of Ithaca and the villages of Cayuga Heights, Dryden, and Trumansburg offer collection services for residents which would make privately contracting with a hauler unnecessary.
Trash tags are available at various locations throughout Tompkins County as well as by mail from each licensed hauler. To find out more about trash removal and where trash tags are available, see the list of licensed haulers in Tompkins County.
Please note: Trash placed in dumpsters does not require a trash tag.
View more disposal options at the Recycling and Solid Waste Center.
Remember to look for ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle items first before you throw them away in your trash.
Frequently Asked Questions


Why do I need to use the trash tag system?

Trash tags are part of a Pay-As-You-Throw program that is required by law in Tompkins County.
The Pay-As-You-Throw system with trash tags encourages reduction, reuse and recycling through a financial incentive.



How do I get trash tags?

Curbside trash customers purchase tags from their hauler to cover the disposal cost of trash set out at the curb.



How is the cost of trash tags determined?

The fee you are charged for trash tags is based on the County disposal fee and covers the disposal cost for trash collected.
For example, if the disposal rate at the Recycling and Solid Waste Center is $106/ton, a 25 pound trash tag must be sold for at least $1.33.



Can my Hauler just give me trash tags?

No. All solid waste haulers must sell tags to their customers. All solid waste haulers must make single trash tags available for purchase by the public at one or more locations or by mail.



Am I violating the law by not using trash tags or is it just my Hauler?

Yes. It is a violation for any person to place solid waste out for collection without a tag required by this Code. Even if your Hauler is telling you it’s okay, you may still be ticketed for failing to use tags.



Can I have my Hauler place a trash tag on the bag or can for me as they pick up the trash?

No. It is a violation of this Code for any person to place solid waste out for collection without a tag. Those generating the trash and placing it out for collection must place a trash tag on the trash.



Can I, or my Hauler, leave the same trash tag on my trash can from week-to-week?

No. The Hauler must remove trash tags as the trash is collected. Trash tags may be disposed of with the bag if the customer has placed the tag on the bag instead of a can.



Can I use one trash tag even though I have several cans or bags?

No. Trash tags are issued and sold in weight denominations reflective of the County disposal fee. No more weight can be placed out than covered by the tag size.



Can I get around using tags by having the Hauler back up in my driveway?

No. The reference to “curbside” in the Code is meant to differentiate between trash placed in a dumpster and trash placed out for regular collection in a bag or can. Boxes, bins and storage sheds are not considered dumpsters.



I have a business and set trash out in cans and bags, do I need to use trash tags?

Yes. Trash tags are required for any solid waste generated or originated on residential property or commercial property set at the curb.



What about farms? Are they required to use trash tags?

Yes. Container Program Solid Waste is any solid waste generated or originated on residential property and any solid waste generated or originated on commercial property placed out for collection.



I live in a Mobile Home Park; do the residents still need to use tags if the park owners pay the service fee?

Yes. Even though the service is under a contract, trash tags are still required.



What happens if I place more weight in the can or bag than the size of the tag on it?

Some haulers place warning stickers on the container without picking it up. Some take only the weight of the trash covered by the tag(s) leaving the remainder.



I am the only stop my Hauler has in Tompkins County, do I still need to use trash tags?

Yes. The Code does not have exemptions for the number of customers a Hauler has. This Code applies to all solid waste generators and Haulers in Tompkins County.



Do I still need to use trash tags even though my trash is taken out-of-County?

Yes. The trash tag system is not based on the final disposal destination.



What if my Hauler sells tags for more than the cost of disposal?

All fees must be listed separately on trash tags. Any other costs such as administration costs must be listed separate from the disposal fee. Contact the Tompkins County Recycling and Materials Management if you have any questions or concerns. 607-273-6632
