Household Hazardous Waste (HHW)






Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) is material that must be handled and disposed of properly due to dangers it poses to our health and the environment.

Registration will become available in early 2026.
Residents must have a valid permit and an appointment to attend an event.

How to Prepare HHW to Bring to a Drop Off Event

Lay down a plastic sheet the under area where hazardous containers will be handled.
Keep HHW away from children, pets, sources of water and flame, and never smoke around HHW.
Keep all products in their original, labeled containers.
Label unidentified products “unknown”.
Never mix chemicals together.
Carefully place items that are in leaking or rusty containers in newspaper and place inside a plastic bag or larger non-returnable container with absorbent material, such as kitty litter.
Do not leave valuables or other belongings in your trunk that you do not want removed.

Drop Off Event/Onsite Instructions

For your safety, smoking is not permitted at the RSWC
For your safety, please stay in your car. You may be asked to push a trunk release button or provide keys to staff to allow access to trunks or hatchbacks.
There may be a brief wait while your materials are checked for acceptability.
Be prepared to wait in line, depending on the volume of material brought by others.
Once your waste has been removed, signs will direct you to the facility exit. All traffic is one-way.
Additional materials can be brought to the electronics drop off area during normal operating hours.

Disclaimer: These suggestions advise safe disposal of products using the best technology available at the present time. TCRMM assumes no liability for the effectiveness or the results of the procedures described on this website. Recycling of hazardous waste is the recommended disposal method for all household hazardous wastes.
