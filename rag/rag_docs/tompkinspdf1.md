Recycle Right in Tompkins County
Single Stream Recycling
Paper, glass, metal, and plastic containers go in the same recycling bin 
Recycling Bin Options:
1. County green recycling bin
• Bins can be purchased at the Tompkins County Recycling 
and Materials Management office.
2. Use a recycling container of your choice
• Size: Up to 50 gallons.
• Weight: Up to 40 pounds when full.
• Container may have wheels and a lid.
• No barrels, or cut barrels.
• Place “R” decal on bin so that the collector can identify 
the container as “Recycling.” (Decals are available for 
free at the TCRMM office and the Public Drop-off Area 
of the Recycling and Solid Waste Center.)
To prepare your recyclables:
  Empty all containers and rinse out residue.
  Place your recycling bin at the curb no later than 6:00 am on your 
scheduled collection day (4:00 am in the City of Ithaca).
  Put “R” decals on both side of your recycling bin parallel to the road so the 
collector can see it.
  Flatten cardboard. If it does not fit in your recycling bin, place next to the 
bin in stacks no more than 4’ x 4’ x 4’.
  DO NOT put plastic bags in your recycling bin or leave items in a plastic 
bag for pick up. They will not be collected.
If your recycling is picked up on the same day as your trash, separate your 
trash set out from your recycling set out so the collector can easily see your 
recycling bin.
