APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONALLY EXEMPT SMALL QUANTITY GENERATORS (CESQG)  
To use Tompkins County’s Household Hazardous Waste Management Facility (DEPOT)  
 
Please read first: State and federal laws exempt some commercial hazardous waste 
generators from strict waste management regulations, based on the amount of hazardous 
waste generated and stored.  To be considered a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator (CESQG), you must: 
 
Produce less than 220 pounds or 28 gallons (100 kilograms) – approximately ½ of a 
55-gallon drum of hazardous waste (“hazwaste”) in any given month; or no more 
than and about 2.2 pounds or 1 kilogram of acutely hazardous waste in any calendar 
month.  
 
You must also never accumulate more than 2,200 pounds (1,000 kilograms) – 
approximately 5 drums of hazwaste on your property. 
 
For assistance in determining your eligibility as an exempt generator, please call 
either the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at 800-452-
1925 or the Tompkins County Department of Recycling & Materials Management  
(TCRMM) at 273-6632. 
 
Once CESQG is established, complete the applications below and email to the TCRMM
