 Recycling Guidelines











                E-Waste: Electronics, Monitors, TVs            

As of January 1, 2015 in New York State, consumers are no longer allowed to dispose of certain types of electronic equipment as garbage. New York State DEC has compiled a list of covered electronic equipment manufacturers and their associated acceptance programs for New Yorkers to utilize to recycle electronics.
Many electronics retail centers and most manufacturers offer take-back programs. You can learn more about each manufacturer’s plan through information provided by the New York State Department of Conservation or by visiting the manufacturer’s website.
Donating used electronics is another option that extends the lives of valuable products and maximizes the energy and resources that went into making the products. Search for local donations centers that accept old electronics. Be sure to check out the Environmental Protection Agency's Electronics Donation and Recycling webpage for more information.
Westchester County accepts electronics at the Household Material Recovery Facility (H-MRF) where residents can book an appointment online and drop off electronics for recycling. Many municipalities also host electronic waste pods. Contact your local municipal office to find out if there is an e-waste pod near you.
