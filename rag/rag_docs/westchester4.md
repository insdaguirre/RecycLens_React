                Household Recycling Days            

The first two Household Recycling Days for 2025 will be:

Sunday, September 7th, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Charles Point Resource Recovery Facility, 3 John Walsh Blvd., in Peekskill
Saturday, October 4, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Sprain Ridge Park, 149 Jackson Ave, in Yonkers
Saturday, November 8, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Playland Park, 1 Playland Pkwy in Rye 

Due to the extreme popularity of these events, residents may experience extended wait times at these events. Residents who wish to avoid potential wait times, or cannot attend an event, are encouraged to make an appointment at the County's Household Material Recovery Facility (H-MRF) located on the Grasslands Campus at 15 Woods Road, Valhalla, NY. The permanent facility accepts the same items as the HRDs and is open year-round, Tuesday-Saturday. 
View our flyer (en español) for more information or call the County's Recycling HelpLine at (914) 813-5425.
HRD's offer an opportunity for residents to recycle household items like old medications, chemicals, paints, electronics, textiles (clothing, footwear, handbags, linens, leather, small area rugs) and more! 
At HRDs, service works on a first-come-first-served basis, and in extreme weather when working conditions are deemed unsafe, events may be cancelled or terminated early. The Mobile Shredder is available at all HRDs, but be advised that on occasion the Mobile Shredder unit can reach its maximum capacity for paper shredding before closing time. Although infrequent, residents should be aware of this and open minded of the possibility of an early closure. On the day of an event, residents can call the County's Recycling HelpLine at (914) 813-5425 to check on a cancellation or early closure.
Follow these simple rules:


Remember to close all bags and bottles tightly.


All chemicals must be in original or labeled containers.


Place all chemicals in a sturdy box and in the trunk of your car.
There is no fee, but pre-registration is required for 100 pounds or more of solid material or 25 gallons or more of liquid. To pre-register, call the Recycling HelpLine at (914) 813-5425.
