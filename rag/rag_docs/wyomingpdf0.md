HOLIDAY COLLECTION SCHEDULE: New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, 
Thanksgiving and Christmas.  If your collection day is on or follows any of these holidays during that week, 
your collection will be one day later. If the holiday falls on a Saturday/Sunday, the collection day will be normal.  
             Ex. 4th of July is on Sunday, the week collection will be normal. 
 
FOR COLLECTION: Place garbage and recyclables at the roadside, within 5 feet of the road, BEFORE 6:00 
A.M. ON YOUR PICK-UP DAY.  If you have a ditch in front of your property, place garbage and recyclables 
between the road and the ditch. 
 Garbage and recyclables will be collected on the same day, possibly in separate trucks and at different times 
during the day. 
 
RECYCLING:  Place all materials inside your recycling bins or containers.  On the opposite side of this sheet 
you will find your recycling guide.  All recyclables can be placed out weekly on the same day as trash pick up. 
 
GARBAGE: The equivalent of 5 bags or cans of normal residential solid waste including garden and yard 
waste, ashes (cold ashes only), plaster, stone, brick and building materials will be picked up weekly.  Place 
garbage in 20 or 30 gallon water tight cans with covers and handles, or (3 mil minimum) plastic bags.  25-55 
gallon drums will not be serviced. Limit of 60 pounds per container or bag.  Securely tie bundles of brush and

matter, industrial waste, fluorescent bulbs and other regulated hazardous waste or building materials left by 
a contractor. 
 
LARGE ITEMS: A large item is anything that cannot be placed in cans or bags easily.  ONLY ONE LARGE
