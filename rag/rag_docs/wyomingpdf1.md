            WYOMING COUNTY/WASTE MANAGEMENT RECYCLING GUIDE 
 
Waste reduction is something that every county resident and business should be doing to help protect our 
natural environment, and save resources and money.  You can help by minimizing purchases, reusing the 
same item, and then recycling. 
 
Every residence receiving waste collection service through the County/Waste Management Program is 
encouraged to recycle as much material as possible.  Please make sure your recycling bin or container is 
visible to the Waste Management collectors. 
 
CALL WASTE MANAGEMENT WITH ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT YOUR SERVICE AT  
1-800-333-6590, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
